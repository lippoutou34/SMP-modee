Or maybe a nether fortress made out of pure magna? Perhaps you are just here to build a house out of dirt or a totem pole with the infamous dioritefaces? Either way we got you covered!\n\nChipped is a 1.16+ building mod that expands on the variety of blocks you can use in-game. The mod offers over 11,000 unique building blocks, from stained glass variations all the way to conerete, prismarine and even gilded blackstone! Not only are all\nthe textures hand-made in the vanilla style, but they also include many connected textures, powered by [Athena](https://modrinth.com/mod/athena-ctm)! \n\nInspired by the popular Chisel mod, Chipped allous builders to have their full range of\ncreativity because every bock deserves a friend!\n\nTo start out all you have to do is craft one of the seven tables that allow you to change various vanilla blocks into their chipped variants. All tables look different, but work the same, so you can pick whichever looks best in your build, or make a few different ones and spread them out in your home. Whatever you want to do, Chipped can help you bring it to life!\n\n---\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r9FApKUUDnE\" title=\"YouTube video player\"

In short, this mod aims to turn the desert and badlands biomes into its own progression section that can compete in terms of utility and combat with the vanilla progression, making your time spent under the hot sun worthwhile. \n\nThe structures aim to fill the vast emptiness in minecraft's terrain generation. Some structures provide the player with new sights to discover and conquer while others exist purely for the visual and ambient touch of each biome. Furthermore, many structures will (at some point) feature unique mechanics like puzzles, secrets or bits of lore. However, it is up to you and your companions to figure out every last detail of each structure.\n  \nFor more information on specific structures please refer to the image gallery.\n\n# 📬 Remarks  \n  \nIf you encounter any bugs or want to suggest a new feature or addition then feel free to open an issue!\n\nPlease keep in mind that at any given time vast amounts of the mod may be edited or completely overhauled! These changes should not, but may leave existing worlds on older versions corrupted. Creating backups before updating to a new version is advised!\n  \nI want to reiterate that this is simply a passion project. It may occur that for longer periods no updates or bug fixes are being developed/released simply because I do not want to.\n","published":"2024-01-03T09:26:17.554913Z","updated":"2024-08-02T15:32:29.011690Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":31485,"followers":55,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["sry7iJRo","2AdlURgZ","6lFO2gb9","wEneELOp","UyMPauYh","aTZR6emc","ER6Rxeyr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ThFWvdF1/5c3125bdf51af70dcc22335ca12216978b2e2c66.png"},"version":{"id":"ER6Rxeyr","project_id":"ThFWvdF1","author_id":"aJP2IRWZ","featured":false,"name":"[1.20-1.20.4] - v1.3.1","version_number":"1.3.1","changelog":"Removed all experimental features including sandstorms and custom items due to performance issues.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-08-02T15:32:29.512799Z","downloads":9419,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8eea41d84d3e95bf16a4a282a19a39b2a70deef7","sha512":"4707d85c178ee8384d9e54e55c987b6a708b9cc6941703c68b90e28f15f5557eaebd68887b5563deb8c3a3f27599b7a5096158c1f24768e1698faad6c375774b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ThFWvdF1/versions/ER6Rxeyr/u_desert-1.3.1%2Bmc1.20-1.20.4.jar","filename":"u_desert-1.3.1+mc1.20-1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":327206,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"tPe4xnPd","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"rwDXIPui","user":{"id":"aJP2IRWZ","username":"UnnamedGlitch","name":"UnnamedGlitch","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/aJP2IRWZ/7e6dee23da5209a85bfada0512135713c19a13a2.png","bio":"Good-for-nothing \"programmer\"","created":"2023-08-07T23:43:06.643259Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"u_desert-1.3.1+mc1.20-1.20.4.jar"},"mods\\Fishingreal-1.20.1-1.7.2.jar":{"sha512":"70297673522f11b74c1717f3ec24c0fbe5d337e8ab82f282425759adb3042c953374a574a0302161002962f1e5fd8de2445da16363160729d327c131407878cd","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"MIdaKqt7","slug":"fishing-real","project_type":"mod","team":"XXjIitfM","title":"Fishing Real","description":"Fish up real entities instead of the items!

In fact, the entire mod uses a datapack for the item->entity conversions!\n\nPlace your jsons in a fishing folder and reload your datapacks to instantly fish new entities!\n\n \n\nThe json format is as follows:\n\n \n```json\n{\n    \"input\": {\n        \"item\": \"minecraft:tropical_fish\"\n    },\n    \"result\": {\n        \"id\": \"minecraft:tropical_fish\"\n    }\n}\n```\n  \n\nThat takes the minecraft:tropical_fish item and turns it into a minecraft:tropical_fish entity!\n\n \nWe can even do NBT for the entities as well!\n```json\n{\n    \"input\": {\n        \"item\": \"minecraft:tropical_fish\"\n    },\n    \"result\": {\n        \"id\": \"minecraft:tropical_fish\",\n        \"nbt\": {\n            \"Variant\": 117834241\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n \nThat will result in a very specific tropical fish each time!\n\n<sub>Also, if you want to override one of the vanilla ones, create your datapack with the namespace fishingreal and override either cod.json, pufferfish.json, salmon.json, or tropical_fish.json</sub>","published":"2022-05-31T17:46:30.870924Z","updated":"2024-07-23T21:19:23.322250Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":254050,"followers":76,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.4","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["8nLxVFhZ","hBcd8mzR","1DPKgD5j","ZRu9gfvX","QkO5f8uN","AVJQAXph","R4N7g7BI","DRnwpTdm","Lh7HTKFW","DVVYhj1a","EWxm55V3","dzb4DsDF","hq79dnLQ","ZavUsuMG","L5q2P5vX","rYWNVxYQ","4x8iFFKy","ni7B0yXV","rsnDg0rK","wajSCh7f","M44pHDr2","nUqpQJ77","J0jowxR2","yuNlrAGu","PMdqos5C"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MIdaKqt7/eea4eb2c431491d1c860fe3ef036be31f11f3f88.png"},"version":{"id":"wajSCh7f","project_id":"MIdaKqt7","author_id":"oUFGJJE9","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1-1.7.2","version_number":"1.20.1-1.7.2","changelog":"## 1.7.2\n- Set position of fish before running nbt randomizing.

Title](https://i.imgur.com/KG3zJMU.png)\n![Life & Death Update](https://i.imgur.com/MBQksdy.png)\n\nWith the theme of archeology being introduced in the Minecraft 1.20 \"Trails & Tales\" Update, it has quickly become clear that Mojang sadly only took a small step into the big world that is archeology.\n\nIt is our goal with this mod to improve upon the mechanics introduced in the update and expand the minecraft universe with new stuff to discover while staying true to the nature of the game.\n\nWe also plan to regularly update the mod to newer versions and provide new content in the weeks to follow.\n\nFor more in-depth info, visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/Pandarix/BetterArcheology/wiki)!\n\n[![Video

Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\nSome other mods (notably those which require Fabric API) may also require that [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) is installed alongside Sodium.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.","published":"2021-01-03T00:53:34.185936Z","updated":"2024-06-29T13:45:48.189812Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":18051116,"followers":15740,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["yaoBL9D9","YAGZ1cCS","1b0GhKHj","80jYkEVr","xuWxRZPd","3JJvf9Kn","6YGRDUVT","Fz37KqRh","5JyduDNN","74Y5Z8fo","Yp8wLY1P","F79MzDJD","rAfhHfow","mnEhtGuH","Nr39FOaS","ObtU68vj","oYfJQ6lR","idtcaIVT","b4hTi3mo","vgceLbdH","hiO9bwqc","OkwCNtFH","6SSPmLc9","4OZL6q9h","bbP1qBMr","lhZYeXLf","zPwAvKCF","InGKdfel","pmgeU5yX","rUXIwGKA","xNJ0Mpbx","umKbm1Rp","Wzzjm5lQ","mhZtY2lR","4GyXKCLd","hLV8Q8uu","IZskON6d","qhg37WBD","dNHeFokL","QHGZ9XSU","dEpHs0Hg","ygf8cVZg","OwLQelEI","RncWhTxD"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ygf8cVZg","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"DzLrfrbK","featured":true,"name":"Sodium 0.5.11","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.5.11","changelog":"This is a minor release of Sodium, further fixing driver checks, adding minor fixes for fluid rendering, and fixing a crash when using specific resource packs that changed the clouds texture.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-29T13:43:41.842195Z","downloads":669884,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"628129702e830fe88d79f0b87ef0591b708fb39045ce3d985703d6a3a78c30c9beb518df8e70151e55ca6c82d9274fea904c016f60085d889a4f7ac431cccd9e","sha1":"c4293c1483f3b39c1c6c4c69143e8bb2c6e53daf"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/versions/ygf8cVZg/sodium-fabric-0.5.11%2Bmc1.20.1.jar","filename":"sodium-fabric-0.5.11+mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":968419,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4reLOAKe","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":"JellySquid","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TEZXhE2U/f4705a5f2388c65029ae2e59f1434b3e6e4de23a.png","bio":"Professional idiot at day, maniac programmer by night.","created":"2021-01-03T00:49:18.373336Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"4reLOAKe","user":{"id":"DzLrfrbK","username":"IMS","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/31803019?v=4","bio":"the Iris guy","created":"2020-12-01T00:40:02.137876Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"sodium-fabric-0.5.11+mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\geckolib-fabric-1.20.1-4.4.7.jar":{"sha512":"887243bf28d6ba02274ebc23fef889de3beefea6bf483a414eef3795af80a3783994dd317ff275d43ef35f5099d031de8509d6acb2253bf9d92625868c33d60e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8BmcQJ2H","slug":"geckolib","project_type":"mod","team":"XGT1SohE","title":"Geckolib","description":"A 3D animation library for entities, blocks, items, armor, and more!","body":"<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/nQsXG5b/Geckolib-Banner.jpg\" alt=\"logo\"/> \n\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/pPEqBgJtZW\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/730912704776110121?color=green&label=Discord&logo=Discord&logoColor=green&style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"discord\"/></a> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/geckosmods\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://shieldsio-patreon.vercel.app/api?username=geckosmods&type=patrons&style=for-the-badge&color=green&logoColor=green\" alt=\"patreon\"/> </a>\n\n<h1 style=\"font-size:10vw\">GeckoLib is an animation engine for Minecraft Mods, with support for complex 3D keyframe-based animations, 30+ easings, concurrent animation support, sound and particle keyframes, event keyframes, and more.

modding on Fabric and Quilt\n \n***\n\nFeatures include:\n\n - [owo-ui](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/ui/), a fully-featured declarative UI library for building dynamic, beautiful screens with blazingly fast development times\n\n - [owo-config](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/config/), a built-in, customizable configuration system built on top of owo-ui. It provides many of the same features as [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) while many new conveniences, like server-client config synchronization, added on top\n\n - A fully automatic [registration system](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/registration/) that is designed to be as generic as possible. It is simple and non-verbose to use for basic registries, yet the underlying API tree is flexible and can also be used for many custom registration solutions\n\n - [Item Group extensions](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/item-groups/) which allow for sub-tabs inside your mod's group as well as a host of other features like custom buttons, textures and item variant handling\n\n - A fully-featured [networking layer](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/networking/) with fully automatic serialization, handshaking to ensure client compatibility and a built-in solution for triggering parametrized particle events in a side-agnostic manner\n\n - Client-sided particle helpers that allow for easily composing multi-particle effects\n\n - Rich text translations, allowing you to use Minecraft's text component format in your language files to provide styled text without any code\n\n***\n\nowo is documented in two main ways:\n\n - There is rich, detailed JavaDoc throughout the entire codebase\n - There is a wiki with in-depth explanations and tutorials for most of owo's features over at

Fight a now much stronger Ender Dragon, with increased health, new attacks, and new phases that progressively up the dragon's difficulty. Through other additions like longer lasting dragon breath, particle ambience, and a climatic final hit, the Ender Dragon fight is now much more exciting and more satisfying to beat.\n\n**Difficulty:** Damage from the True Ending Ender Dragon is scaled by difficulty, so if you're looking for a greater challenge, set your world's game mode to Hard. This also works by making the fight easier with Easy mode.\n\n# Boss Music\n\nTrue Ending adds boss music to the Ender Dragon boss fight! If you're using the datapack version, you'll have to [download the resource pack by clicking here](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/true-ending-ender-dragon-music). Mod users won't have to install the resource pack as its already nicely installed along the mod jar file.\n\n# Settings\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure multiple settings in True Ending, like the Ender Dragon's health, through its settings menu by using `/function true_ending:_settings` in chat.\n\n# All Features\n \n<details>\n  <summary>Show All Additions and Changes</summary>\n\n\n- Ender Dragon Health has increased from 200 HP to 300 HP\n During the Ender Dragon boss fight, boss music now plays to all players at the center island\n- Ambient particles now surround the arena and players during the Ender Dragon fight\n- Added a dragon dive attack that creates a huge shockwave when the Ender Dragon hits the ground\n - Additionally, a variant where it performs 3 dives (Triple Dive) when perching at 75% health or lower\n- Added a chain fired Dragon Fireball attack\n- Added a huge laser attack\n- Added a final phase where the Ender Dragon hovers above the ground for the player to levitate and deal the last blow mid air.\n- Caged end crystal towers are now broken in a more intuitive way: A phantom guards it and when the phantom is killed, the cage is broken\n- At 10% HP the Ender Dragon will be immune to damage till perched. If not already perched or about to perch, it will forcefully perch after 30 seconds\n- Added an End Crystal counter when an End Crystal is broken displaying how many are left to break\n- Everyone within 128 blocks of the center end island now receives the \"Free the End\" advancement after defeating the Ender Dragon\n- Ender Dragon respawn animation revamped\n- When the Ender Dragon is respawned, a sound is played globally to all players in the end dimension\n- Dragon Breath/Area Effect Clouds from Dragon Fireballs duration increased from 30 seconds to 1 minute\n- Dragon Fireballs now deal damage directly on impact\n- Dropped Ender Pearls break from new Ender Dragon attacks (this is to prevent obtaining massive amounts of Ender Pearls from the Enderman killed during the fight)\n- Ender Dragon knockback resistance has been increased massively to prevent arrows from locking the dragon mid-air before perching\n- End Crystal fire is now soul fire\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n***\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT

mod inspired by storage drawers that aims to allow for easy creation of powerful yet not\noverpowered storage systems using simple components.\n\n## Features\n### In-game Guide Book\nCrafted by combining a book with and upgrade frame, the guide book will explain in more detail how the mod works.\n**[Patchouli](https://modrinth.com/mod/patchouli) is required for the guide book to load ingame!**\n\n### Drawers\nDrawers are blocks that can store a lot of a few items and come in three variants: single-, double- and quad-slot. \nThey can be interacted with in world or using hopper or pipes from other mods.\nThey will make up the bulk of your storage as they are cheap and effective.\n\n### Access Points\nAccess points are blocks that can interact with multiple drawers that are connected to them. \nThey only support insertion in world, but can be extracted from using pipes and hoppers.\nYou can use them to quickly dump your inventory into the system, or hook up digital storage.\n\n### Shadow Drawers\nShadow drawers show the amount of a resource that is available in the whole network and allows\nfor insertion and expansion of that resource. \nThey are especially useful for automation as you can keep storage centralized and still access it from far away.\n\n### Compacting Drawers\nWhile slightly more expensive to craft compacting drawers offer a lot of convenience over regular drawers.\nThey automatically compress and decompress your items using 2x2 and 3x3 crafting recipes. \nThey also store more of items as the max capacity is based on the most compressed stored item.\n\n### Upgrades\nUpgrades are items that extend the capacity of a drawer slot. Their power can be tweaked in the config.\nThere is also a downgrade if you need to limit the capacity of a drawer slot. \nThey apply to individual slots and not the whole drawer, unlike other mods.\n\n### Locking\nYou can use a lock on drawers to make them keep their selected item even when empty.\nThis makes sure you don't lose your organisation when you remove items and allows you to block automation from filling up empty drawers.\n\n### Voiding mode\nIf sneak clicked with a lava bucket, drawers will start voiding excess items. \nThis is useful when you want to store items of low value as you don't need to worry about overflow.\nExtended drawers will make sure drawers without voiding enabled fill up first.\n\n### Hidden mode\nHide icons on drawers to reduce lag or hide your valuables, but remember, anyone can change it.\nApplied by sneaking and using black dye or ink sacs on drawers.\n\n### Duping mode\nAs for 1.20, you can use a by default unobtainable dupe wand to toggle duping mode on drawers.\nThey will continue to provide items even when empty. Voiding mode must still be applied separately.\n\n## Customization\nExtended drawers offers two main ways to customize the experience: the configs and datapacks.\n\nThe configs can be located under the `config` directory in your installation root, under `extended_drawers`. \nThere are two files: one for client side setting and one for settings needed on both the server and client. \n\nAll recipes and loot tables can be modified by datapacks like with most mods. \nYou can find some of the defaults under `src/main/resources` and others under `src/main/generated`.\n\nExtended drawers also provides the option to override what items the compacting drawers can compact and how.\nThis is done through files placed under `data/<namespace>/extended_drawers/compression_overrides` in json format.\nThe files should consist of a single object with items as keys and compression levels as values. \nHere are some examples:\n\n```json5\n{ \n  // Adds compacting support to clays. It isn't default as you can't craft it into balls\n  \"clay_ball\": 1,\n  \"clay\": 4\n}\n```\n```json5\n{ \n  // You should never need to do this, but here's an example of how a file for iron might look like\n  // You can see that numbers are based off of the amount of first item\n  \"iron_nugget\": 1,\n  \"iron_ingot\": 9,\n  \"iron_block\": 81\n}\n```\n```json5\n{ \n  // Disables compacting for gold nuggets. \n  // You have to do this for each tier or something might break.\n  \"gold_nugget\": 1\n}\n```\n\n## Other Info\n### Modpack permission\nYou can use this mod in any modpack as long as you don't reupload the mod. \nYou can get a direct download link from modrinth if you need, \nbut I'd prefer you create your modpacks on modrinth or curseforge directly.\n\n### Other websites\nThis mod is only officially available on [curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extended-drawers), [modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/extended-drawers) and [github](https://github.com/mattidragon/extendeddrawers). \nAny other sites are third-party reuploads and should not be trusted.\n\n### Porting and Forking\nYou can read my policy on [forking and porting mods](https://gist.github.com/MattiDragon/6b9e71e8516447f53f0d5fb296ab8868).\n\nCurrent target: 1.20.1 and 1.20.2.\n\n### Incompatibilities\nI intend to try and stay compatible with as many mods as possible, but might abandon support for some if it becomes too hard.\n\n* **Sodium** is only compatible if [indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) is installed.\n* **Optifine** will never be officially supported. Might work, might not.\n\n## Licencing \nVersions 1.3.0 and older and their source code are licensed under the MIT license. Newer versions\nare licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

the feeling of the old vanilla style dungeon boxes!

It can be found in plains biomes and savanna's\n\n**Infested Dungeon**: This mountain dungeon has been overtaken by an infestation! make sure you watch your step!\n\n**Webbed Dungeon**: Found within minecraft's wooded forests, this dungeon could almost be mistaken for a small fortress.\n\n**Lush Dungeon**: The lush jungles & caves provide a nice home for these cave spiders. Be careful however as the dungeon is very small & cramped.\n\n**Deepwater Dungeon**: These are usually found below the depths of the ocean and in dripstone caves.\n\n**Cold Dungeon**: The cold of the tiaga is not enough to stop these bone breakers. Makes me wonder if skeletons can even feel temperature in the first place?\n\n**Frozen Dungeon**: Wet and cold, this dungeon brings with it a formidable stench from all of the strays.\n\n**Dusty Tomb**: Mostly dry and sandy. The husk here are not very welcoming.\n\n**Scorched Tomb**: Deep in the badlands these will be found. Dungeons full of zombies and loot for those who do a little searching!\n\n**Witch Shack**: Well whatever shack was there seems to be in disrepair.\n\n\n## Dungeons+ Loot\nThis data-pack uses vanilla loot tables!

Also, Villagers can teleport to you when being dismounted. **(Also works for Villagers riding on Boats and Minecarts.)**\n\n**Updated Description: Villagers no longer teleport at you when being dismounted and Llamas no longer get a speed increase when leashed and ridden.**\n\n\n **Notable Issue: Right-clicking on employed Villagers opens their trades GUI when being dismounted from rideable entities.**\n\n","published":"2023-08-18T20:24:39.177024Z","updated":"2024-06-17T06:08:29.779594Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":221629,"followers":272,"categories":["adventure","mobs","transportation"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","23w31a","23w32a","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["bb0ROC62","z1Ynj1Ty","k3DxZYtB","NJIAGCmX","L9qrPDfu","1OujLueL","7vFN03W5","bcmtgsIt","KN2JB3hx","UfHfCsci","vxuOpN9i","nyR88Nxa","3Dg114tw","c6BtwQYg","XVGKRBc8","h944DaZa","R7UPo883","X9G5sRdi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vLUPqRLH/7b276f3cc79620281ee58feeefe34508a46631aa.png"},"version":{"id":"c6BtwQYg","project_id":"vLUPqRLH","author_id":"SzdMDF1k","featured":true,"name":"(Mod) v1.3.1 - 1.20 - 1.20.4","version_number":"1.3.1+mod","changelog":"# v1.3.1\n- Tweaked the advancement \"And the Caravans and Bees\" that requires when players riding the Camel with a Villager to lead the Llama with a Villager riding on it","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-17T06:00:12.675279Z","downloads":46684,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"3bf795632dbb2ef1665bc44d8c38433d2ee622bb61236570f202e352d48badc6d9697d071b3c895a3b9e083b095a7f106b182ae7cd3041f83b645799995232e6","sha1":"7e9d4ad20cd534c15e60ab78fe76eead01f8b084"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vLUPqRLH/versions/c6BtwQYg/villager-transportation-1.3.1.jar","filename":"villager-transportation-1.3.1.jar","primary":true,"size":257444,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"nWM9ccE4","user":{"id":"SzdMDF1k","username":"Jaffthry","name":"Jeffery Stern","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/SzdMDF1k/2f8934537a36e310c81aa86cc5217eff04bd8ce5.png","bio":"An part-time Minecraft Datapack Creator","created":"2023-08-18T05:46:59.173851Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"villager-transportation-1.3.1.jar"},"mods\\entity_model_features_fabric_1.20.1-2.1.3.jar":{"sha512":"31820ac89d75c433e9a340c3ee1cc793be4a97a418d9b73a8cc3fcbf6f8e077472e47db2a63092981c80e4200a74f1a21f4c36acf38ecd5b9b8b6036e6b99d5e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"4I1XuqiY","slug":"entity-model-features","project_type":"mod","team":"fXLgMy6f","title":"[EMF] Entity Model Features","description":"EMF is an, OptiFine format, Custom Entity Model replacement mod available for Fabric and Forge.","body":"<div align=\"center\">\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/master/fabric/src/main/resources/icon.png\" alt=\"EMF icon\" width=200>\n\n# Entity Model Features\n \n[![Modrinth downloads](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/entity-model-features?color=00AF5C&label=downloads&style=round&logo=modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features)\n[![CurseForge downloads](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_844662_downloads.svg)](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-model-features)\n\n[![Enviroment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple)](https://modrinth.com/mods?e=client)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/950942125225283634?color=blue&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/traben)\n\nEntity Model Features (EMF) is a Fabric, Quilt & Forge mod that adds support for OptiFine's Custom Entity Models (CEM).<br />It's designed for anyone who wants to use the CEM resource pack features but to use mods such as Sodium, Continuity or ETF.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/49f5b98dfef5b073a3971750673d343e1f92efe5.png\" alt=\"EMF in use\" width=550>\n\n</div>\n\n## Required Mods\nPlease also install the below mods if you can, the obvious ones such as Sodium are not mentioned.\n\nIt should also go without saying EMF is NOT compatible with dorianpb's CEM and OptiFabric.\n#### Required\n- [Entity Texture Features (ETF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures): \n  EMF uses several features from my other mod ETF, so it is required. (primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n##

automatic data and resource packs.</p>\n<p>Usually, data packs have to be loaded separately for every world. Paxi adds the <b><em>paxi</em></b> folder in your Minecraft config folder, where you can place data and resource packs that will automatically be loaded for every world. The first time you run Paxi, the <b><em>paxi&nbsp;</em></b>folder will be created for you in your Minecraft config directory.</p>\n\n<p>Paxi is as simple as it gets when it comes to global data and resource packs, making it a great utility for modpack creators!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9VzCAAC.png\" alt=\"Data packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nWithin the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <b><em>datapacks</em></b> folder for data packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed. Any data packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded into any world you play - in other words, globally loaded data packs! When in game, use the command <code>/datapack list</code> to see all loaded data packs; packs loaded by Paxi are printed in pink text. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported.</p>\n\n<p>\nData packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>datapack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of data pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your data packs loaded in. Using this JSON file is entirely optional - any data packs not listed in the file will be loaded normally (alphabetically by folder/zip file name, same as normal data packs). So if you only have a few data packs that require loading in a specific order, you only need to list them in the JSON!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cSWd9iG.png\" alt=\"Resource Packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nAlso within the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <em><b>resourcepacks</b></em> folder for resource packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you run the game with Paxi installed. Any resource packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded when you start the game. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported. Resource packs are not supported on dedicated servers, since they only affect the game on the client-side (textures, sounds, and other assets).</p>\n\n<p>\nResource packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>resourcepack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of resource pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your resource packs loaded in. Using this JSON file is entirely optional - any resource packs not listed in the file will be loaded normally (alphabetically by folder/zip file name, same as normal resource packs). So if you only have a few resource packs that require loading in a specific order, you only need to list them in the JSON!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>","published":"2022-11-28T23:58:44.154428Z","updated":"2024-07-24T22:04:52.422825Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":705879,"followers":227,"categories":["management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["fZAUUop4","PGslvGfk","nAUDoZw6","guE4gNYH","QzQxGeh0","ncI5s51y","PndwEY0C","t0EvcKWk","C7buFh0l","UVPLKCqf","dfKKJWz8","kOPN246o","ocPyiL4C","DMlcRLLS","QGaIWzeS","uZ8fe7Rg","U1iCcvJ6","SELXigfX"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/CU0PAyzb/a44cd118cf27547d17dc13a008cdb4efe53aa6d1.png"},"version":{"id":"UVPLKCqf","project_id":"CU0PAyzb","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.20] v4.0 (Fabric)","version_number":"1.20-Fabric-4.0","changelog":"1.20 and 1.20.1 release!  \n\nIf you want to get early access to all my mods, [Join the Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/yungnickyoung)  \n[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/rns3beq)  \n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung) for more mod updates!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-12T22:26:08.930147Z","downloads":402446,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"21ef7cc460c6c1fd15443a69f77b165a4096b135","sha512":"81a9918d6730db5d9b1b1eae3a7104ba4d83557aa90308b9acc1026cae1789265b7ebde9c6a573ebaca91bae6e0988f069f442f4d18d63f1c46909a758080e9e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/CU0PAyzb/versions/UVPLKCqf/Paxi-1.20-Fabric-4.0.jar","filename":"Paxi-1.20-Fabric-4.0.jar","primary":true,"size":225237,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ua7DFN59","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"uDMN8ZzP","user":{"id":"HCGwycZf","username":"YUNGNICKYOUNG","name":"Nick Young","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HCGwycZf/f4ec4b86f9778f12367fbd3a3e9f9e6af6830bee.png","bio":"Mr. Better Minecraft","created":"2022-11-13T01:46:47.603854Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"uDMN8ZzP","user":{"id":"f74fCorY","username":"Drullkus","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5010174?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-12T01:48:09.113754Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Paxi-1.20-Fabric-4.0.jar"},"mods\\letsdo-herbalbrews-fabric-1.0.8.1.jar":{"sha512":"739543020aa7000ae4c273bdec4f9517a46efbec43baaebf7dbb5c40a5304a8209f5d6c5c0350deeda7fecbbfe6820d53975b248f68c5d0c2aa17bdd7d6f0804","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Eh11TaTm","slug":"lets-do-herbalbrews","project_type":"mod","team":"sagl8qX4","title":"[Let's Do] HerbalBrews","description":"It's Tea Time!

These can then be either cultivated as tea plants or dried. Combine 9 tea leaves and place the block outside.\n <br>\nTo process dried tea, you have two different tea kettles available: copper and iron, both of which only differ aesthetically. Place the kettle on a furnace, add all the required ingredients, wait a moment, and enjoy your tea!<br>\nMost teas have effects that positively impact all players within a certain radius.\n <br>\nThere is also the option to create potions. For this, a brewing cauldron is required. Potions come in vials and have long-lasting strengthening effects. To brew with style, there are various hats inspired by witches and wizards.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nPlease note that while Herbal Brews is hopefully playable without major issues, it is still under development.

included via Jar-in-Jar to allow it to be removed from `fabric.mod.json`, which was causing issues in developement environments when Night Config wasn't retrieved from the official Maven, but instead production jars were used, e.g. from the Curse Maven\n- Note that Night Config is shaded without being relocated to a different package, which is necessary to stay consistent with Forge\n###

It does require OptiFine to work, though.\n\n> **Q: Can you make a Bedrock port?**  \n> **A:**  It's not as simple as porting it. To make a version that would work on Bedrock, I would have to start from scratch. So that's not something I plan to do any time soon if ever.\n\n> **Q: Can you add player animations?**  \n> **A:**  Sadly no. Optifine currently doesn't support player animations. It may be possible with other mods, but I haven't looked into it yet.\n\n> **Q: Why isn't the ___ animated? Can you add it?**  \n> **A:**  Not all the mobs are animated yet. Fresh Animations is a Beta pack so it is developed over time, so new mobs animations will be added in major updates.  \n> I work and add new animations at my own pace, so please refrain from requesting animations.\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have white eyes and no new animations when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This occurs when you haven't installed the Optifine Mod correctly, OR Custom Entity Models is not enabled in Video Settings. The required settings are as follows:  \n> _Video Settings > Quality > Custom Entity Models: ON_  \n> **A:**  This can also happen with some 3rd party clients.  \n> **A:**  Also make sure you're using the right Optifine version (refer to the next question below).\n\n> **Q: Why are the mobs invisible / have invisible parts?**  \n> **A:**  This happens with some game versions including 1.18.1, 1.18 and 1.17.x. Use Optifine HD U H9 or newer to use the main pack.  \n> For 1.18 and 1.17.x, use the alternative version of the resource pack  [(FreshAnimations_v1.7_Alt.zip)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fresh-animations/files/3919356).\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have big purple/black textures when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This often occurs when the pack is loaded in. I think it's caused by an Optifine bug. To solve this, you need to exit the game and re-launch it.\n\n> **Q: Is Fresh Animations compatible with ___ ?**  \n> **A:**  Probably not completely. Textures for some mobs break with other packs as they are resized in FA. Other packs with custom entity models won't work as it would override the models FA.  \n> Otherwise, textures for most mobs should be fine. A solution for some packs is to make an 'addon' version using Optifine CEM Parts.\n\n> **Q: The pack is warning me that it's made for another version of Minecraft. Which version should I get?**  \n> **A:**  Any version of this pack should work as intended in most versions, as long as there's a version of Optifine to run it. I recommend using the latest version for the latest updates and new animations.\n> Don't worry about the version warning!\n\n> **Q: Is there a way to use Fresh Animations without OptiFine?**  \n> **A:**  Fresh Animations requires Optifine features like Custom Entity Models (CEM) to work. Some Optifine CEM alternative mods are being developed.

These essentially correspond to the vanilla regular and jigsaw structure types, but with better placement and a clearer json format.\nBoth types can choose from the following placements:\n| Identifier | Description |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| `surface` | Will place the structure at the top layer of solid blocks |\n| `ceiling` | Will place the at the bottom layer of solid blocks |\n| `on_water` | Will place the structure at the top layer of blocks if those blocks are water |\n| `on_lava` | Will place the structure at the top layer of blocks if those blocks are lava |\n| `underground` | Will place the structure somewhere between the top and bottom layers of blocks |\n| `underground_surface` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, at the bottom of an open area |\n| `underground_ceiling` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, at the top of an open area |\n| `underground_buried` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, such that it is not exposed to any open area |\n| `underground_on_lava` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, in an open area on top of lava |\n\n### Structure Pool Element Types\nFormations adds one new structure pool element type, `formations:single_pool_element`. The element type allows setting a different ground level rather than vanilla's fixed ground level of 0. The ground level can be set through the `ground_level` key.\n\n### Structure Processors\nFormations adds a bunch of new structure processors.\n| Identifier | Parameters | Description |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| `formations:random_bed_color` | - | Randomizes the color of any beds |\n| `formations:biome_replacements` | - | Replaces certain blocks, such as wood, bricks and grass, based on the biome |\n| `formations:fill_brewing_stands` | `slotFillChance`, `maxBlazePowder` | Fills brewing stands with random potions and blaze powder ` |\n| `formations:fill_chiseled_bookshelves` | `slotFillChance` | Fills chiseled bookshelves with enchanted books |\n| `formations:block_age` | `mossiness`, `degradation`, `disintegration` | Randomly replaces regular blocks with mossy or cracked variants, full blocks with slabs or stairs, random blocks with air |\n| `formations:random_plant_growth` | `minGrowth`, `maxGrowth` | Randomizes the growth stage of any crops |\n| `formations:respawn_anchor_charges` | `minCharges`, `maxCharges` | Randomizes the number of charges of any respawn anchors |\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/LqyZP68.png)\n\n## Examples\nFor examples usage of the features, you can check out [<img width='25' alt='formations overworld logo' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KX1XC0Oo/623ec34d4dbc1ca9c5aa6477f9043e86bbaa899b.webp'> Formations Overworld](https://modrinth.com/mod/formations-overworld) and [<img width='25' alt='formations nether logo' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cGvQGRls/2e21f4c247ad58965c320f037c4febfa9cf827bb.webp'> \n Formations Nether](https://modrinth.com/mod/formations-nether)\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/V9cw31J.png)\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Can I use your mod in my modpack?**  \nYes, feel free to use my mod in your modpack\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/boQSGyP.png)\n\n## Discord\nFor future content, upcoming mods, and discussion, feel free to join the SuperMartijn642 discord server!

By \"purely technical\" I mean that it won't add any content to your game.\n\n### The Problem\n\nMod creators are encouraged to use tags where possible, e.g. when creating a recipe. If mods are supposed to work together though, they should all share a same base of common \"conventional\" tags, which group certain items together. Not all developers add their items to common tags though, which means that a person playing with many mods or a mod pack creator might need to create long lists of all items which fulfill certain criteria to add them to specific tags.\n\n### The Solution\n\nUpon loading a world, this mod will automatically populate some tags based on code conditions, covering all modded content as well.\n\nIt's mostly relevant for mod pack creators who need / want to configure mods by adding to specific tags - this allows them to e.g. easily add all armor items to a tag, because they'll all be bundled in `c:armor`.\n\nAs another example, all items which are equippable in the head slot will land in a tag called `c:head_equippables`:\n\n![Screenshot of the `c:head_equippables` tag](https://i.imgur.com/2E36FZS.png)\n \n\n### Additional Information\n\nFor an overview of the tags the mod currently adds, as well as the blacklist option via datapacks, [view the README on GitHub](https://github.com/apace100/autotag/blob/1.18/README.md).\n\nIf you have any suggestions for new tags, feel free to post them in the comments or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/apace100/autotag/issues)!\n\n\n\nI hope this mod helps someone and makes their life a bit easier. :)\n\n----\n\nThe mod icon is a composition of modified icons created by

And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config.

JEI will be hidden.\n\n## What does EMI bring to the table?\n\nOf course EMI comes with every feature you'd come to expect from the outset, viewing recipes, favoriting items, searching, and the like. But what's new that EMI offers?\n\n* A craftable mode for **quickly crafting** any recipes you're able to make, usable by toggle or as a config for empty searches\n* **Recipes** can be **favorited** with items, and also can be used to quickly craft at a button press\n* A **recipe tree** for breaking down the cost of a complex craft, showing you **every step**, how many **base ingredients** you need, and what you'll have leftover\n* A **recipe tree crafting mode**, counting up the materials and steps you need to be complete to finish a task, including **synthetic favorites** in your sidebar you can use to **craft every step** for exactly as much as you need\n* Smart display of **tags**, with translations, models, and tooltips, showing you ingredients at a glance, such as \"Planks\" instead of slowly rotating through every plank in the game.\n* Smart breakdowns of base costs, letting recipe trees automatically break down to base ingredients, and letting you define **your own defaults** as you play\n* **Tooltips** for recipes, tags, and ingredients showing you what will be crafted, and what makes up an ingredient\n* Binds for quick crafting **straight into your inventory or cursor**, one or many at a time, in conjunction with recipes favorites or the craftable mode\n* A **clean** and **modern** API, built from the ground up to be simple, powerful, and suit all of EMI's features\n* **Zero third party dependencies**. EMI only requires standard, first party Fabric/Quilt APIs\n\n\n## What does EMI stand for?\nIt doesn't, it's not an acronym. Or maybe it's an acronym without a meaning? If it makes you more comfortable, you can pick one from the list below, or make your own up.\n\n* Emi Memy Imi\n* Exhaustively Many Items\n* Explicitly Mandated Items\n* Endless Material

village mod for 1.19-1.21 focused on making all villages in an upgraded and more suitable style for some players. Every village has its own unique build style and loot, which makes them fun to discover and explore. \nAlso,  pillager structures have also been remade, including the Outpost, Mansion, and swamp hut. Along with these vanilla structures, more custom villages and structures are planned, including a Jungle, Swamp, and Pillager Village.\n# Attention: \nThis data pack is now in its beta, some custom villages and structures have not been added yet, but they are on their way. Some villages may generate oddly due to vanilla terrain.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Spoiler</summary>\n\nRoadmap:\n\n-BETA-\n\nBeta v1.1- Pillager Village Ships, and Dungeons.\n\nBeta v1.2- Jungle Village and Snowy Village Re-Remake.\n\nBeta v1.3- Witch Village and Swamp Hut Re-Remake.\n\nBeta v1.4- Iceberg Village and Badlands Village\n\nBeta v1.5- Meadow Village and Secret Village.\n\n-A config menu and some extra QOL things, can't do these yet because I can't really code but hopefully in the future.\n\n</details>\n\n","published":"2024-04-15T01:57:31.291032Z","updated":"2024-08-15T16:50:32.827581Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":63720,"followers":280,"categories":["adventure","decoration","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kmOzI8Wr","sbV48K00","8lEBKJTv","MPbMvS6g","X9qgqhnL","vIqTTAaC","vGyg5rSw","uYwPXbSg","5lTBZwZ2","bzU7MXet","Or0FIw5F","EtZf2Gve"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8Lw09aLb/1fe6e772cadaf3739e0790b587027c3e9b37f885.png"},"version":{"id":"uYwPXbSg","project_id":"8Lw09aLb","author_id":"MaOfK80o","featured":false,"name":"v0.7 1.19-1.20.6 | Luki's Grand Capitals (Fabric)","version_number":"0.7","changelog":"Added the Woodland Mansion","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-22T18:43:15.414321Z","downloads":35706,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"807ffd86ddc654d05129060eba25859bfb4ac55e1769a37fd46bde048572251dc7ad218d9b676a5349b7eabe9fb27ec5106feaf3961adc8e6117bbd8ff3e0bed","sha1":"baf469c24aa495985689f8dfb8ca8376792a428d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8Lw09aLb/versions/uYwPXbSg/luki-s-grand-capitals-0.7-fabric-1.19-1.20.6.jar","filename":"luki-s-grand-capitals-0.7-fabric-1.19-1.20.6.jar","primary":true,"size":2621683,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"mAdTMTCE","user":{"id":"MaOfK80o","username":"lukidonu","name":"lukidon","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/MaOfK80o/b84d85a09173430dbe3738cbd217c142bcb62953.png","bio":null,"created":"2024-04-02T16:57:21.231543Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"EtZf2Gve","project_id":"8Lw09aLb","author_id":"MaOfK80o","featured":false,"name":"V1.0 1.19-1.21 | Luki's Grand Capitals","version_number":"1.0+mod","changelog":"- Welcome to Beta!\n- Separated Grand Capitals from vanilla villages, other village structure mods are now usable along with Grand Capitals. \n- Mod compat for the following: Bountiful, Waystone mods, More Villagers, Villagers Plus, and any other mods that change the village structure (Better Villages, etc).\n- Changed the loot tables of everything to use the same name as their vanilla counterparts, so now (hopefully) you should be able to get loot from other mods.

Thank you all so much! If anyone has any ideas for new cave biomes, feel free to suggest some!</i> </center>\n\nProfundis is a world generation mod which adds <b>nine</b> new vanilla-styled underground biomes to the game. These seven new underground biomes make the depths of the world significantly more diverse—what was once just three underground biomes is now ten! Mojang claimed that Caves & Cliffs would make the underground even more varied than the surface; Profundis aims to add much needed variation to the underground. \n\n<i>Profundis is a server-side mod, meaning it can be installed on a server and clients can join without needing to install a mod, much like a plugin! It can also be installed on a client for singleplayer!</i>\n\n<h3> Biomes </h3>\n\n❄The Frozen Caves typically generates below cold regions of the world, and has icicles hanging from the ceiling with small ice and snow patches on the ground. Aquifers generating here have a layer of ice on the top, just like frozen lakes and rivers on the surface. Redstone is also extrememly abundant here.\n\n🍄The Mushroom Caves can generate beneath more humid biomes. They have mycelium patches on the ground, with a plethora of small red and brown mushrooms generating everywhere. Huge mushrooms also spawn, although they spawn more often in large caves than small caves. Shelf Fungi line the walls, occasionally glowing with Shroomlights, in addition to the biome's higher rate of Glow Lichen.\n\n🌋The Molten Caves can generate in almost any environment. They have lava deltas meandering throughout the stony slopes of the caves, with an abundance of lava springs as well. Basalt columns similar to those in the Basalt Deltas also spawn, although not as frequent as in the Nether. Small patches of Smooth Basalt can occasionally generate on cave surfaces in the Deepslate layer as well. Iron is more abundant here.\n\n🔮The Amethyst Caves generate underneath hillier areas. They are filled with beautiful Amethyst Veins, with calcite and smooth basalt cracks in the cave walls. The crystals leave a gentle glow, alluring miners with their serenity.\n\n⚫The Black Caves generate in almost any environment. They have walls of Tuff, Deepslate, and Blackstone, hence the name. They also lack Glow Lichen, making it difficult to see in large caverns.\n\n🟧The Arid Caves generate under hotter areas. They have floors of sand and red sand, with sand in higher levels and red sand below deepslate level. The walls are made up of Terracotta bands of a variety of colours. They generate much like Frozen Caves, but in hotter biomes and rarer.\n\n🌸The Floral Lush Caves are a variant of Lush Caves. They are exactly identical, except with a floor made of a variety of flowers. Pink Pedals coat the moss, while a mix of all flowers native to the Flower Forest grow in the moss.\n\n⚪️The White Caves generate in almost any environment. Much like the Black Caves they have walls of Diorite, Calcite, and Andesite, hence the name. They generate in the same area as the Black Caves.\n\n🎨The Painted Caves generate most commonly in tropical areas. They have walls of multicolored terracotta in a mesmerizing rainbow pattern.\n\nAll of the cave biomes' generation can be disabled individually in the config by simply changing a value.\n\n<h3>Structures</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n🪵Cabins generate in every Vanilla and Profundis cave biome, but not in barren caves. They are small to mid-sized bunkers, originally constructed as small bases for miners. They each contain a few functional blocks such as furnaces and crafting tables, plus barrels with loot. The barrels typically have mediocre loot with a pickaxe thrown in, but occasionally contain more valuable treasure. In addition, the loot found in the barrels matches what biome the structure spawns in.\n\n🧊Ice Dungeons are a variant on regular Monster Room dungeons that spawn in Frozen Caves. They contain an icy arena with a Skeleton Spawner and 8 pre-spawned Strays (I opted to not use a Stray Spawner as to not contradict with Vanilla's precedent on Strays; if you would like that to change let me know!). They additionally contain four barrels full of typical dungeon loot plus snow and ice.\n\n🍄Mushroom Houses are an uncommon structure generating beneath Mushroom Fields and in Mushroom Caves. They are non-hostile and contain a few chests of loot, plus some standard utilities. Loot is not very rewarding, but can be a useful source of food in a pinch.\n\n🔮Amethyst Dungeons are a slightly more difficult version of regular Monster Room Dungeons, generating in Amethyst Caves. They contain one Zombie spawner and one Skeleton spawner, and a Diamond Block in the middle as a reward. \n\n⛲️Sanctuaries are underground fountains generating in Lush Caves and Floral Lush Caves. They contain a Gold Block and a rare blue Axolotl.\n\n🏮Blackstone Lanterns are small lightposts generating in Black Caves. They contain one barrel in the center of the structure—but make sure to open the barrel at night for optimum loot! If opened during the day, their loot will be lackluster.\n\n🗿Deep Statues are uncommon humanoid statues generating in Frozen Caves, Mushroom Caves, Amethyst Caves, Black Caves, and Arid Caves. They contain eight Iron Blocks in the head of the structure.\n\n\n\n<br><i>If any of you have any ideas for new cave biomes or structures please let me know on my GitHub!

You will be able to create a datapack which adds new dungeons which can get accessed via overworld structures. Those dungeons will be joinable with friends, offer good loot and usually have a cooldown.\n\nBy default, one dungeon is added. For further info, how to add your own dungeon, check out the github readme.\n\n![Showcase](https://i.imgur.com/lY60Aby.png)\n\n\n![Showcase](https://i.imgur.com/Yfw3ACl.png)\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WKCuHQL.png\" alt= “Misc” width=\"10%\" height=\"auto\">\n<br><br />\n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ol1Tcf8.png\" width=\"25%\" height=\"auto\">](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7weZ8uu.png\" width=\"25%\" height=\"auto\">](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)\n\n\n\nThis mod is developed for Fabric.  \nThere are no plans to develop a Forge version. \n\n\nModpack Permission:  \nFeel free to use it in any modpacks.\n\n\nBug Report:  \nJust report bugs at the github page.","published":"2023-05-20T20:07:52.231916Z","updated":"2024-07-13T16:22:15.867743Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":323511,"followers":93,"categories":["adventure"],"additional_categories":["library","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["sl2FuoWu","Ukjd4XYm","XziIttdX","f9cJFSOt","FbeCvvOo","EGLBlhmV","ty1nvImD","mLJ0xsHg","IoQfGPq7","RaRL6Eba"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/11jwniuC/7dffe71230977cc1daec92a0deb3a1daf506c5e4.png"},"version":{"id":"IoQfGPq7","project_id":"11jwniuC","author_id":"tGFAjHNa","featured":true,"name":"dungeonz-1.0.6+1.20.1","version_number":"1.0.6+1.20.1","changelog":"### Added:\n- \n### Fixed:\n- Fixed null crash\n### Changed:\n- ","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-07-01T15:40:04.552220Z","downloads":20697,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"1a081c62c427ce427f59a6c84a2991857de4360b","sha512":"13cf4355430b5f41a29899f776471ec8716e19b3dfa4ece282ee59dc9dcea77165233db5a2cdd4facdd629b924040f11ad33c930ccd6ed8c39e0544071569015"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/11jwniuC/versions/IoQfGPq7/dungeonz-1.0.6.jar","filename":"dungeonz-1.0.6.jar","primary":true,"size":938805,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"ac33649bcf7e066017af9b0a39980cf3ec2eae1c","sha512":"e1bb077c8556600aa23c74fa96b0806e9c2c8ce94de19bb905b237a06ad02b869aeb7b2cd3a6b9367672356b7c2d8ac8db437b0a33ca5c70e4f99ae7f2860dbb"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/11jwniuC/versions/IoQfGPq7/dungeonz-1.0.6-sources.jar","filename":"dungeonz-1.0.6-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":844186,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"vpKX7sXT","user":{"id":"tGFAjHNa","username":"Globox1997","name":"Globox_Z","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55102939?v=4","bio":"Made in Germany","created":"2022-07-25T11:26:54.514233Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"dungeonz-1.0.6.jar"},"mods\\defaultoptions-fabric-1.20-18.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"de031f360129299c8b0e64f071cac1223886bed4094a5eadd4f15336f63df172cdc90bdb89e4bebfb98c420b74bd2ee9a70057dd5569363217d6db73e4a7fb13","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"WEg59z5b","slug":"default-options","project_type":"mod","team":"EhVsb590","title":"Default Options","description":"A way for modpacks to ship a default (key) configuration without having to include an options.txt file.

Configure the options, keybinds and server list as you would like them to be shipped in the modpack\n2. Join any world and run \"/defaultoptions saveAll\" to save your current options in the defaultoptions folder (located in the config folder where it should remain)\n3. Do not include the options.txt and servers.dat from the root directory in your modpack\n4.

Read below for setup instructions.\n\nFabric versions depend on [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n\nRequired both on client and server\n\n\nIf you encounter any issues please report them on issue tracker\n\n[Detailed setup guide(Recommended)](https://github.com/CmdrJane/time-and-wind/wiki/Setting-Up)\n\nSetup:\n\nWhile in game use /taw set-cycle-length <dimension> <day length> <night length>\n\nFor example /taw set-cycle-length minecraft:overworld 24000 9000 will set day duration to 24000 ticks and night to 9000 ticks for dimension overworld\n\n20 ticks = 1 second, 1200 ticks = 1 minute, 72 000 ticks = 1 hour\n\nIf you want to remove configuration for world use /taw remove-cycle-entry <dimension>\n\nWorld id can be obtained using /taw get-current-world-id, this command will print id of current world you are in\n\nYou can also navigate to config/time-and-wind/time-data.json and make changes there.\n\nAfter all changes made use /taw reload to apply them\n\n#### Seizure warning: Setting values less than 12000 may cause epilepsy or other unwanted side effects!\n\nNote: Custom configuration for dimensions that have fixed time will obviously not work. In Vanilla you can only configure custom time length for overworld, but if you have modded dimensions without fixed time you will be able to set custom time length for them and it will work.\n\n\nThis mod also patches getSkyAngle method in order to make day and night length even since in vanilla day is a little bit longer than night. This can be disabled in config file.\n\n\nHow does mod works:\n\nUsing mixin mod redirects call to setTime in tickTime method passing control to custom ticker method. That means you don't need to set game rule doDayLightCycle to false for this mod to function.\n\nFor further information you can check [this package on github](https://github.com/CmdrJane/time-and-wind/tree/1.19.4/src/main/java/ru/aiefu/timeandwindct/tickers)\n\n[Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZxkBkoJL1o&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Flegacy.curseforge.com%2F&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY&feature=emb_logo)\n\n \nModpack permission: Very yes","published":"2023-07-02T01:00:10.595421Z","updated":"2023-12-20T02:46:05.817354Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":160081,"followers":60,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["xyGo8Lhp","b89DFps7","m2K6lODF","ekUhgFYi","FaFtc7bt","KFjv7bVx","8vT0D2cU","S5bGqt8i"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/e7pPr7RQ/375d7eb8c324a74fdd318658582f9cfa949035d9.png"},"version":{"id":"FaFtc7bt","project_id":"e7pPr7RQ","author_id":"W0Cc2qRP","featured":false,"name":"Time & Wind 1.4.8+1.20-1.20.1","version_number":"1.4.8+1.20-1.20.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-18T12:38:06.241022Z","downloads":141604,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"4f39832e1f318a5f47aaeee3c79c5e4e0807830bd1836863d56b216e8bcf597c90d897b7a5c3556eb314a69c6793de45b423d6a11f524523ab5fcea3ddbbb864","sha1":"1022457b115552a2326a86570899e4c3a10ca57b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/e7pPr7RQ/versions/FaFtc7bt/time-and-wind-ct-1.4.8%2B1.20-1.20.1.jar","filename":"time-and-wind-ct-1.4.8+1.20-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":67076,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"eN4lXnj0","user":{"id":"W0Cc2qRP","username":"CmdrJane","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48736985?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T10:43:40.863236Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"time-and-wind-ct-1.4.8+1.20-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\nutritionz-1.0.9.jar":{"sha512":"862a8e5059ab4f6160878d998cfb6ab617906093facb81816812b445cef0baef57f49ae41bce06d29f78b20500e935bfdd5cc2cd5ec1717f5b72c1c77b97f3c7","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"9IASI8W8","slug":"nutritionz","project_type":"mod","team":"QLpkQOxs","title":"NutritionZ","description":"Nutrition system which has 5 nutrients to challenge your diet","body":"<center>\n\n![nutritionz title wide](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/e89b5dba6f292ca0b6118fb317af37b86f10d455.png)\n*A nutrients mod for fabric.

This is required for mod configuration, as it allows for using the exact same system as on the Forge mod loader.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

Instead, the block states are set directly in the palette storage,\nthus bypassing calculations Minecraft does that are normally useful when block states are set, but when generating the world only slow it\ndown. This is a cycle optimisation.  \nThere are also 3 other optimisations, that increase biome population speed, block state sampling speed and chunk unlocking speed (Minecraft\n1.21 and up) during world generation.\n\nNoisium has full 1:1 parity with vanilla worldgen (worldgen without Noisium).\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Required\n\nNone.\n\n## Compatibility info\n\n### Compatible mods\n\nNoisium should be compatible with most, if not all, of the popular optimisation mods currently on Modrinth/CurseForge for\nMinecraft `1.20.x`, since Noisium aims to fill in the gaps in performance optimisation left by other mods.\nThis includes (but is not limited to) C2ME, Lithium, Nvidium, and Sodium.\n\n- C2ME: every world generation thread runs faster. The biome population multithreading is also done in a much better/more performant way in\n  C2ME, so it's been removed from Noisium since `v1.0.2`.

In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB.

So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*.

This API's main purpose is to help optimize and speed up the development of mods, as well as to avoiding re-writing the same code for every mod that needs to do similar things. Please note that because this mod is a library, it may not offer useful front-end features to the user.\n\n## Dependencies\nNote that \"client\" refers to installing mods to the game launched through a Minecraft launcher, whereas \"server\" refers to installing mods to a server you join through the \"multiplayer\" menu.\n\n| Requirements | Client | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/P7dR8mSH) | Required as of `1.20.5` | Required as of `1.20.5` |\n\n## Purpose\nAs mentioned earlier, the primary goal of this API is to enhance and accelerate the development of Minecraft mods, while also eliminating the need to rewrite redundant code for each mod that performs similar tasks. In the beginning, the initial purpose of this API mod was to provide a better the GUI system that's easier to work with, but it has since evolved to include various useful events, hooks, and utilities that may be commonly used.\n\n### Mods that use this API\nThis API mod is primarily used by [TheCSDev](https://github.com/TheCSDev) for developing [Better Statistics Screen](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats).\n\n## API features\n### Client-side\n- **GUI System**: A unique, user-friendly UI system that aims to be an improvement from the vanilla GUI system in terms of customization and flexibility.\n- **HUD Screens**: This feature enables the rendering of `Screen`s on the in-game HUD for visual enhancement. Please note, these HUD `Screen`s are for display purposes only and cannot be interacted with via user input.\n\n### Common-side\n- **Auto-config system**: Simplify the creation of JSON configuration files for your mod with this system. It automatically serializes fields of primitive types defined in the config `Class` during the saving and loading of configs.\n- **Event System**: Allows you to listen for various in-game events. It also allows you to define custom events for your mod, which other mods can listen to.\n- **Hooks**: Gain easy access to various game components with the help of these hooks.\n- **Networking**: This API comes with its own custom-payload-network, enabling other mods to communicate in both C2S and S2C directions over the game's network protocol.\n- **Utilities**: Benefit from a range of utilities, including various interfaces, enums, exception types, IO utilities, threading, and more. One such utility is a caching system that allows mods to perform asynchronous operations to fetch/load resources and cache them.\n\n## A simple introduction to the GUI system\nWith the GUI system, you can create your own custom GUI menus, in a simpler way that allows for more customization and flexibility.  \nIn the vanilla GUI system, we use `Screen`s. In this API's GUI system, we use what's called `TScreen`s.\n\nAll GUI components, including `TScreen`, and GUI widgets, can be found in the following package:\n`io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.client.gui`.\n\nBelow we will create an example `TScreen` implementation, with a simple button on it that does something when it's clicked:\n```java\nimport io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.client.gui.screen.TScreen;\nimport io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.client.gui.widget.TButtonWidget;\nimport net.minecraft.text.Text;\n\npublic final class ExampleTScreen extends TScreen\n{\n\t/*\n\t * `super` takes a `Text` argument for the screen's title\n\t */\n\tpublic ExampleTScreen() { super(Text.literal(\"Example TScreen\")); }\n\t\n\t/*\n\t * This is where the screen initializes its GUI elements.\n\t * We will add the button widget here.\n\t */\n\tprotected final @Override void init()\n\t{\n\t\t//create the button, and center it on the screen\n\t\tfinal var button = new TButtonWidget(\n\t\t\t(getWidth() / 2) - 50,  //the button's X position. we will center it\n\t\t\t(getHeight() / 2) - 10, //the button's Y position. we will center it\n\t\t\t100, //the button's width\n\t\t\t20   //the button's height\n\t\t);\n\t\t\n\t\t//define a text for the button\n\t\tbutton.setText(Text.literal(\"Click me\"));\n\t\t\n\t\t//now let's do something when the button is clicked\n\t\tbutton.setOnClick(btn ->\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t//print a simple message to the console\n\t\t\t//when the button is clicked\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\n\t\t});\n\t\t\n\t\t//and finally, let's add the button to the screen\n\t\taddChild(button);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nNow, we need to open the screen and show it to the user. To do so, we use `MinecraftClient#setScreen(Screen)` (on Fabric), and we use `TScreen#getAsScreen()` to obtain the `Screen` reference. So our final code will look like this:\n```java\nfinal var tscreen = new ExampleTScreen();\nfinal var screen = tscreen.getAsScreen();\nMinecraftClient.getInstance().setScreen(screen);\n```\n\n## A simple introduction to the event system\nThe event system allows you to not only listen for various events already provided by this API, but it also allows you to create and invoke your own custom events.  \nBelow is an example of how you can create your own event, register and unregister listeners, as well as invoke the event:\n```java\nimport io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.event.TEvent;\nimport io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.event.TEventFactory;\n\npublic final class ExampleEvents\n{\n\t/*\n\t * This is how we create a custom event using this API.\n\t * Note that this event system is similar to Architectury API's event system,\n\t * but with some tweaks and additions done to it, for more flexibility.\n\t */\n\tpublic static final TEvent<Runnable> eSomething = TEventFactory.createLoop();\n\t\n\tpublic static final void registerAndUnregisterListener()\n\t{\n\t\t//we first define the listener that will be invoked when the event is invoked\n\t\tfinal Runnable listener = () -> { System.out.println(\"The event was invoked.\"); };\n\t\t\n\t\t//then, this is how we can register it\n\t\teSomething.register(listener);\n\t\t\n\t\t//and then, this is how we can unregister it\n\t\teSomething.unregister(listener);\n\t}\n\t\n\tpublic static final void invokeEvent()\n\t{\n\t\t//we invoke the event by obtaining the \"invoker\",\n\t\t//and calling the functional interface's main function\n\t\t//(in Runnable's case, the main function is `run`)\n\t\teSomething.invoker().run();\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\nI appreciate and value everyone's contributions to this mod, whether it involves translating the mod, offering feedback, or providing valuable suggestions.

(but not really)™ for Blay's multiplatform mods. This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

Notice that it has the eyebrows at the third position.\n\nThe version of this pack with animated eyes (Expressive Fresh Moves.zip) will also have the extra pixels on the default Minecraft skins (Steve, Alex, Makena, Efe, Noor, Kai, Ari, Sunny, and Zuri) as an example. ****\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Features in Fresh Moves:**\n-This resource pack overhauls the idle, walking and swimming animation and gives some othe details to the player.\n\n![Running](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/22d2e93235eb421566c030489277234dfadc7e73.png)\n![Idle](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/c343e36d2c1492bcc47cf27cb5d26394cde89109.png)\n \nThis resource pack has been made with special compatibility for [Parcool](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/parcool), [Quark's](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark) emotes, [Not Enought Animations](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/not-enough-animations), [Amendments](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/amendments) and [Real Camera](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/real-camera) mod.

To generate all important directories and files, start the game one time with the mod installed and close it again.\n2. Open the newly generated folder named 'resources' in your '.minecraft' directory. This is the directory the mod will load your resources from.\n3. Copy all resources you want to load to the 'resources' folder. If you want to load resources from a resource pack, copy everything from inside the pack's 'assets' folder to this directory.\n4. Start the game and you will now be able to use the loaded resources in mods and resources from a resource pack will be visible in game.\n\n**Nice To Know:**\nThe `resources` folder is like the `assets` folder in a resource pack. So namespaces work exactly the same as for a normal resource pack.\nFor example: If you put a texture in `resources/mytextures`, the namespace of textures inside the `mytextures` folder will be \"mytextures\".\n\n## Bug Reports and Requests\n\nYou can report bugs and request features either on [GitHub](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Load-My-Resources/issues) or via [Discord](https://discord.gg/UzmeWkD)!\n\n## Modpacks\n\n\"Load My Resources\" can be freely used in modpacks.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nTo my patrons:<br>\n- Kreezxil<br>\n- q!!!<br>\n- Jolihan<br>\n\n## Copyright\n\n\"Load My Resources\" Copyright © 2021 Keksuccino.<br>\n\"Load My Resources\" is licensed under KML (Keksuccino Mod License).<br>\nSee \"Custom License\" in the \"About Project\" section for more informations about the license.\n\n## Server Needed?\n\nYou need a Minecraft server to play with your friends but it's just too much work to setup one on your own?<br>\nNo problem, just rent an ready-to-use server and start playing in a snap!\n\nJust click on the image below and use the code **keksuccino** to get **25% off** your first month!\n\n<a href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/keksuccino\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35544624/100003401-505d5300-2dc6-11eb-9444-3dd117a8aef9.png\" width=\"241\" height=\"244\" /></a><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><br /></span></p>","published":"2022-11-23T22:33:01.363745Z","updated":"2023-09-24T04:55:52.476727Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1012949,"followers":116,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["wYEBYtRc","LS7zFG0F","ZvOOKnBo","7wNkRxrR","BlnsvnLh","ncfcapSO","XS4A9Aoo","ErYeBTin","7WP876Jm","gXzSBMIG","EQeLLVsf","q8si2roM","VA60FWUa","lsBN5Uh2","8MDPsQ9J","vO7R2WNi","L7MIAeTT","r45QO9Cd"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/TqCKvqjC/52f56718a4367dbf009524348c325bd86a81aed4.png"},"version":{"id":"vO7R2WNi","project_id":"TqCKvqjC","author_id":"k0LcYHWE","featured":false,"name":"[Fabric] v1.0.4-1 MC 1.20-1.20.1","version_number":"1.0.4-1-1.20-fabric","changelog":"\n<br>- Fixed crash on 1.20\n\n<br>","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-12T22:15:48.501064Z","downloads":774846,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"41f4157cfc13708dec15a09b09fe4d58809f54fd714b8cde3c1200d26135b2abe3057985a28e70fd925c2d3132782953c60c342cc6844163fe1fea506d7631b5","sha1":"9d873d3ac0a95de8dcd29cdde362b7fe72c4dc04"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/TqCKvqjC/versions/vO7R2WNi/loadmyresources_fabric_1.0.4-1_MC_1.20.jar","filename":"loadmyresources_fabric_1.0.4-1_MC_1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":61614,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"3092ea886eafe925b11d8cf3ab40fe371e38edfdf5321ecfd5f91638d198b763919e88671390b73d9f37f6742088e1f9bff35a0774d2bb5cd1c1297f20dcbd0c","sha1":"878c4b97c1970b51c7206963c1fac7e4b82727e1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/TqCKvqjC/versions/vO7R2WNi/dev_loadmyresources_fabric_1.0.4-1_MC_1.20.jar","filename":"dev_loadmyresources_fabric_1.0.4-1_MC_1.20.jar","primary":false,"size":73998,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"MQVnLgFq","user":{"id":"k0LcYHWE","username":"keksuccino","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35544624?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-03-30T18:22:57.742857Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"loadmyresources_fabric_1.0.4-1_MC_1.20.jar"},"mods\\moonlight-1.20-2.12.10-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"8287e133d9c1aee36cab5abef942b5f4c209ae034c6b224afae4ec8cdef08a8e15a9f1e1f980977d94c8717aafae55f08c34bc92db31f0790ec164f48de46555","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"twkfQtEc","slug":"moonlight","project_type":"mod","team":"Se0LRYS8","title":"Moonlight Lib","description":"dynamic data pack and registration, villager activities, custom map marker and a lot more","body":"Features of this library are:\n\n- Dynamic resource pack utilities\nA set of utilities that allow creating dynamic runtime resource packs and datapacks. Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily.

and filters button, where Mod Menu is selected. On the right side of the screen, it shows more details about the mod, such as authors, a description, links, credits, and a button to configure the mod.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mOgUt4GM/images/155dd2b006883b168b1279ec0ff21e753946518b.png)\n\nMod Menu lets you view the mods you have installed and, if supported by the mod, enables quick and easy access to the mod's config screens.\n\nMod Menu also supports some more advanced features, such as translatable mod names and descriptions, support for [QuickText formatting](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/quicktext/) in mod descriptions thanks to [Patbox](https://ko-fi.com/patbox)'s [Text Placeholder API](https://modrinth.com/mod/placeholder-api), filters library mods out from regular mods, a mod update checker for mods hosted on Modrinth or that provide their own update sources, and deep configuration for all the features we provide.\n\n### Supported Platforms\nMod Menu is currently available for Fabric or Quilt on Minecraft: Java Edition 1.14 or newer.\n\n## Developers\nMod Menu includes a number of APIs for developers to improve how their mod appears in Mod Menu. These come in the form of language keys, JSON metadata, and even a Java API.\n\n### Translation API\nYou can translate your mod's name, summary, and description all without touching any Java code. Simply add translation keys in the supported format to any language you'd like.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Translation API Documentation</summary>\n\nHere's an example of Mod Menu's translations into Pirate Speak. To create your own, simply replace `modmenu` at the end (***NOT*** the one in the beginning) of the translation key with your own mod ID, for example `modmenu.descriptionTranslation.traverse`.\n\n`en_pt.json`\n```json\n\"modmenu.nameTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods!\",\n\"modmenu.descriptionTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\",\n\"modmenu.summaryTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\"\n```\n\n> The summary translation is redundant here and does not need to be included because it's the same as the description, but it was included to show that you may translate the summary (a short, one-sentence description of the mod) separately from the description, even in English!\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n### Fabric Metadata API\nThere's a number of things you can add just with metadata in your `fabric.mod.json`.\n\nAll of these are added to a custom block in your `fabric.mod.json` for Mod Menu's metadata. Here's an example usage of many of the features this API provides:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n      \"links\": {\n        \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n      },\n      \"badges\": [ \"library\", \"deprecated\" ],\n      \"parent\": {\n        \"id\": \"example-api\",\n        \"name\": \"Example API\",\n        \"description\": \"Modular example library\",\n        \"icon\": \"assets/example-api-module-v1/parent_icon.png\",\n        \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n      },\n      \"update_checker\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Fabric Metadata API Documentation</summary>\n\n#### Badges (`\"badges\": [ ]`)\nWhile the `Client` badge is added automatically to mods set as client-side only (set `\"environment\": \"client\"` in `fabric.mod.json` to do this.), other badges such as the `Library` and `Deprecated` badges require definition here.\n\nSupported values:\n- `library` - should be assigned to mods that are purely dependencies for other mods that should not be shown to the user by default unless they toggle them on.\n- `deprecated` - should be assigned to mods that exist purely for legacy reasons, such as an old API module or such.\n\nAny others will be ignored, and Mod Menu does not support adding your own badges. You may open an issue [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/issues) if you have a compelling use case for a new badge.\n\n#### Links (`\"links\": { }`)\nThe `links` object allows mod authors to add custom hyperlinks to the end of their description. If you specify a `sources` contact in the official `fabric.mod.json` metadata, it will also be included in the links section.\n\nAny key in the `links` object will be included in the links section, with the key being used as a translation key. For example, this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nwill show as a link with the text \"Discord\", since \"Discord\" is the English translation of \"modmenu.discord\" provided by Mod Menu.\n\nMod Menu provides several default translations that can be used for links. A full list can be seen in Mod Menu's language file [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/blob/-/src/main/resources/assets/modmenu/lang/en_us.json). All default link translation keys take the form `modmenu.<type>`.\n\nYou can also provide your own translations if you would like to add custom links. Make sure to use ***your own namespace*** (as opposed to `modmenu`) for any custom keys.\n\n#### Parents (`\"parent\": \"mod_id\" or { }`)\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZutCprf.png\">\n\nParents are used to display a mod as a child of another one. This is meant to be used for mods divided into different modules. The following element in a `fabric.mod.json` will define the mod as a child of the mod 'flamingo': \n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": \"flamingo\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you want to group mods under a parent, but the parent isn't an actual mod, you can do that too. In the example below, a mod is defining metadata for a parent. Make sure that this metadata is included in all of the children that use the fake/dummy parent. This can also be used as a fallback for an optional parent, it will be replace by the mod's real metadata if present.\n\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": {\n            \"id\": \"this-mod-isnt-real\",\n            \"name\": \"Fake Mod\",\n            \"description\": \"Do cool stuff with this fake mod\",\n            \"icon\": \"assets/real-mod/fake-mod-icon.png\",\n            \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDummy parent mods only support the following metadata:\n- `id` (String)\n- `name` (String)\n- `description` (String)\n- `icon` (String)\n- `badges` (Array of Strings)\n\n\n#### Disable update checker (`\"update_checker\": false`)\nBy default, Mod Menu's update checker will use the hash of your mod's jar to lookup the latest version on Modrinth. If it finds a matching project, it will check for the latest version that supports your mod loader and Minecraft version, and if it has a different hash from your existing file, it will prompt the user that there is an update available.\n\nYou can disable the update checker by setting `update_checker` to false in your Mod Menu metadata like so:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"update_checker\": false\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Quilt Metadata API\nSince Mod Menu supports Quilt as well, the same APIs in the Fabric Metadata API section are also available for Quilt mods, but the format for custom metadata is slightly different. \n\nInstead of a `\"modmenu\"` block inside of a `\"custom\"` block, you put the `\"modmenu\"` block as an element in the root object. So it should look like:\n\n`quilt.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"modmenu\": {\n    // Here's where your links, badges, etc. stuff goes\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Java API\nTo use the Java API, you'll need to add Mod Menu as a compile-time dependency in your gradle project. This won't make your mod require Mod Menu, but it'll be present in your environment for you to test with.\n\n`build.gradle`\n```gradle\n// Add the Terraformers maven repo to your repositories block\nrepositories {\n  maven {\n    name = \"Terraformers\"\n    url = \"https://maven.terraformersmc.com/\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Add Mod Menu as a dependency in your environment\ndependencies {\n  modImplementation(\"com.terraformersmc:modmenu:${project.modmenu_version}\")\n}\n```\nThen, define the version of Mod Menu you're using in your `gradle.properties`. You can get the latest version number [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/version/latest), but you may need a different version if you're not using the latest Minecraft version. See the [versions page](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions) for a full list of versions.\n\n`gradle.properties`\n```properties\nmodmenu_version=VERSION_NUMBER_HERE\n```\n> If you don't want it in your environment for testing but still want to compile against Mod Menu for using the Java API, you can use `modCompileOnly` instead of `modImplementation` (this will work even if Mod Menu is not updated to the version of Minecraft you're running).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Java API Documentation</summary>\n\n### Getting Started\nTo use the API, implement the ModMenuApi interface on a class and add that as an entry point of type \"modmenu\" in your `fabric.mod.json` like this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"entrypoints\": {\n  \"modmenu\": [ \"com.example.mod.ExampleModMenuApiImpl\" ]\n}\n```\n\n### Mod Config Screens\nMods can provide a Screen factory to provide a custom config screen to open with the config button. Implement the `getModConfigScreenFactory` method in your API implementation to do this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for mods to provide their own config screens. The mod id of the config screen is automagically determined by the source mod container that the entrypoint originated from.\n\n### Provided Config Screens\nMods can provide Screen factories to provide a custom config screens to open with the config buttons for other mods as well. Implement the `getProvidedConfigScreenFactories` method in your API implementation for this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for a mod like Cloth Config to provide config screens for mods that use its API.\n\n### Modpack Badges\nMods can give other mods the `Modpack` badge by implementing the `attachModpackBadges` method, such as through the following:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void attachModpackBadges(Consumer<String> consumer) {\n\tconsumer.accept(\"modmenu\"); // Indicates that 'modmenu' is part of the modpack\n}\n```\n\nNote that 'internal' mods such as Minecraft itself and the mod loader cannot be given the modpack badge, as they are not distributed within a typical modpack.\n\n### Static Helper Methods\n`ModMenuApi` also offers a few helper methods for mods that want to work with Mod Menu better, like making their own Mods buttons.\n\n#### Creating a Mods screen instance\nYou can call this method to get an instance of the Mods screen:\n```java\nScreen createModsScreen(Screen previous)\n```\n\n#### Creating a Mods button `Text`\nYou can call this method to get the Text that would be displayed on a Mod Menu Mods button:\n```java\nText createModsButtonText()\n```\n\n</details>","published":"2020-11-06T05:11:04.725058Z","updated":"2024-06-21T14:44:42.928177Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":11250164,"followers":11036,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.4","1.16.5","21w06a","21w14a","1.17-pre1","1.17","1.17.1","21w37a","21w38a","1.18","1.18.1-pre1","1.18.1-rc1","1.18.1-rc2","1.18.1-rc3","1.18.1","22w03a","22w05a","22w06a","22w07a","1.18.2-pre1","1.18.2-pre2","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2-rc1","1.18.2","22w15a","22w16b","22w17a","22w18a","22w19a","1.19-pre1","1.19-pre2","1.19-pre3","1.19-pre4","1.19","22w24a","1.19.1-rc1","1.19.1-pre2","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w43a","1.19.3","23w03a","23w05a","23w07a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4-pre2","1.19.4-pre3","1.19.4-pre4","1.19.4-rc1","1.19.4-rc2","1.19.4-rc3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","23w17a","23w18a","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","23w31a","23w32a","23w33a","23w35a","1.20.2-pre1","1.20.2-pre2","1.20.2-pre3","1.20.2-pre4","1.20.2-rc1","1.20.2-rc2","1.20.2","23w40a","23w42a","23w44a","23w45a","23w46a","1.20.3-pre1","1.20.3-pre2","1.20.3-pre3","1.20.3-pre4","1.20.3-rc1","1.20.3","1.20.4-rc1","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b","24w03a","24w03b","24w04a","24w05a","24w05b","24w06a","24w07a","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6-rc1","1.20.6","24w18a","1.21-pre2","1.21-pre3","1.21-pre4","1.21-rc1","1.21","1.21.1-rc1","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["M3KFXLhq","DgzrfgAZ","O90fUm3q","zC13OZD9","7QWIhei3","79rtoAM6","kBofQyu4","TleLdS1A","PqgXyy3N","Mnl0OeFI","pxj9L3Vy","6YvLIUDN","wb5nbuL5","bPE0GIoY","pqlMITZQ","RIf7gcLA","Gz5wa6j2","EDbIonje","wRE7Emzz","mzVbb1XI","bHODZExo","a8bewBQT","NyFB1gry","oQr5VO7q","u955lyFM","E4QBMVtO","c6uDXZX8","bojzkt4w","4Ar2wg0k","G8sCBZ1X","JyL5b75a","GOPQZTVp","Wr4GfZdy","tlM0eBmY","DOitjZ89","XtL1i60M","VaZTuVan","FMqdptUn","aH8qgnVM","9xECQHnM","LVxVja5i","JOqf8AZn","WKj0jgYj","jZQ0G78K","PN4NcBa1","WkUCkcQA","3CD6YUw1","JPP6w2U1","eueI9czw","4JrWqhWw","Ui2loaCY","fw5MM4c4","6f25OJ7w","E4VKK6kQ","y8cYdaYa","GYRoFp1I","Tk7mCRX1","aShj7736","dP3zrFbp","cx9D94fU","pnFEFiHq","ybXxCvz4","NsD1IoUs","oU5qfeR6","2Ys0a7JE","8TOgNwQL","kQDE01D3","3umfHb6R","Gbkn1raO","d86kV6wd","NAs8eiQa","RxrqnH1z","GI1HTA1O","sI3kiPZE","4dReZoTJ","7mdkE3Od","qDXCbEz4","IPLgxPn7","V4hnfgRO","nVxObSbX","7kh2ofyR","eIrlBn1Z","yA8g3pEj","oqeCO757","4LXaG2xg","5qqTBb38","7E8dbVv0","5aw4r6fS","pyDmgV07","jRqFAHRH","4EOA40rU","gSoPJyVn","RtaGQNyd","sXVmzBDB","U31K6311","JYTmttex","pged5sGx","5e62j63G","nM5QaZNo","aMxXwo9x","3gwnUSKz","yjjsLqbS","RdCGzY7B","EuNUYds8","iZRiOnnj","M7LIgtWJ","RTFDnTKf","CtMNOUcV","zv46i3PW","VHzvWfY2","sLzitH81","id0aLmxO","eTCL1uh8","lMqXEzUw","jbNN4rAs","lEkperf6","sMAXpy0X","TwfjidT5","qpKaDJtd","Edgke5GX","tXEHCONL","4EYB2Bxx","fCQyI9Zj","sjtVVlsA","ua8KrvY4","mtTzRMV2","w3icASIi","VOHp29AO","ybV7vGT5","NgnZx44E","9FL4cmP7","KXx8jdVE","YLesFuAc","I7OSH8Gw","jnj30PDT","HLa8flfl","FawTQg29","lJ1xXMce","xhN1IvHi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mOgUt4GM/1b6bcdef5a3d92572f517122650716be7ec6458b.webp"},"version":{"id":"lEkperf6","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","author_id":"Dc7EYhxG","featured":false,"name":"v7.2.2

Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.\n\nFor basic tutorials and comprehensive documentation, visit this project's [wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Home).\n","published":"2021-06-08T00:05:32.472592Z","updated":"2024-07-15T11:03:13.629144Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":2164215,"followers":1269,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17-rc2","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["70Ajg5iP","dRgbv7A2","29Jd2Dm4","qpiOPBB9","R2UW6ejS","FdJA5sbK","DtvgyMK2","vOuy3Z5S","XqLNMi9J","WiXqMygm","oLUBJhyv","9qrmAiwv","OLwsMJv4","5zEAvqnX","A5kxdEY3","z8ProfKL","e563ycts","tJ23Vcff","AHxQGtuC","7aQD4OG8","SGjPO8H9","JagCscwi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"AHxQGtuC","project_id":"5aaWibi9","author_id":"R6WsWKy9","featured":false,"name":"Trinkets 3.7.2","version_number":"3.7.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-11T04:25:11.224830Z","downloads":647843,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d58cc8759587f03f320f188972ca66baa788d008","sha512":"bedf97c87c5e556416410267108ad358b32806448be24ef8ae1a79ac63b78b48b9c851c00c845b8aedfc7805601385420716b9e65326fdab21340e8ba3cc4274"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/versions/AHxQGtuC/trinkets-3.7.2.jar","filename":"trinkets-3.7.2.jar","primary":true,"size":238532,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"F0xlmrbH","user":{"id":"R6WsWKy9","username":"Emi","name":"Emi","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14813658?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-10-26T21:52:52.726926Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"trinkets-3.7.2.jar"},"mods\\GeckoLibIrisCompat-Fabric-1.0.0.jar":{"sha512":"f11507d76dd7b28e3b96fe98eb14041983f7db8d17984fdc4b3555d6f0245fd0b09b9f233c0f4b8ba9ffd6882a5df45d5c41a94839c0b4fb1bbd329d7f51b954","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"TbriQCWD","slug":"geckoanimfix","project_type":"mod","team":"vOPPtsyL","title":"Iris/Oculus & GeckoLib Compat","description":"Fixes GeckoLib animations not working if using a shaderpack with entity shadows.","body":"# Iris / Oculus & GeckoLib Compat\n\nFixes GeckoLib entities' animations not working while using shaderpacks that have entity shadows.\n\nExample of a GeckoLib entity working with Insanity Shader, using entity shadows.\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5kLo4HdSz44\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

Viewfinder,\ncompose your shot and release the shutter.<br>\n- Press/Hold Sneak when looking through Viewfinder to control Camera\nsettings: Focal Length, Shutter Speed, Flash mode, Composition Guides.<br>\n- Use the Camera while sneaking to open the Attachments window,\nwhere you'd be able to:\n    - Load a Film\n    - Equip the Flash (Redstone Lamp)\n    - Modify the Lens (Spyglass)\n    - Put a Filter on the lens (Glass Panes)\n\n<h3>Film</h3>\n\n- To capture an image you'll need to expose light-sensitive film.\n- You can use simpler black and white film or, more sophisticated\nand harder to make and process, color film.\n- Single film roll can fit 16 frames on it.\n- Developing is required to prepare film for printing.\n\n<h3>Lightroom</h3>\n\n- Photographs are printed with the help of a Lightroom block.\n- Negatives can be previewed before printing to help you choose the\nbest exposure.\n- Black and white print requires Paper and Black Dye.\nColor print will require Cyan, Magenta and Yellow dyes on top of that.\n\n<h3>Photograph</h3>\n\nAnd finally, you have your Photograph - a captured moment in time!\nNow it's time to admire the result, hang it on the wall, share with\nfriends, sell it to the National Geographic.

The whole tree will only break after a certain number of chops, and bigger trees require more chops. Inspired by mods like Treecapitator.\n\n#### Cool features:\n- Doesn't get too loud when breaking big trees\n- Works on mushrooms and fungi\n- Intelligently breaks leaves\n- Compatible with most modded trees\n\n#### Things to consider when lumberjacking:\n- Chopping trees doesn't require an axe, but will take a while without one\n- Chopping different blocks of the same tree will all contribute to bringing down the tree\n- Players can work together to chop down those big trees\n- Bigger trees require more total chops, but fewer chops per block*\n- Hold \"sneak\" when breaking a log block to break it normally\n\n_*By default, the number of chops required to fell a tree is computed logarithmically. Some example numbers are below. The number of chops can also be configured to scale linearly with the number of blocks to, for example, require one chop per block, or one chop per tree.

This should be fixed for 1.19+ versions. See [#106](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop/issues/106).\n- Some modded trees leave floating blocks when felled.

How do I turn off chopping?\nPress n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle off the \"chopping\" setting. A key can also be bound to toggle chopping without opening the settings screen; go to Options > Controls and find the section labeled \"HT's TreeChop\".\n\n#### 2. How do I keep chopping off and only turn it on while sneaking?\nBy default, sneaking inverts your current chop setting, so just toggle chopping off (press n to access the settings screen) so that chopping will be enabled by sneaking.\n\n#### 3. How do I keep chopping even when sneaking?\nPress n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle off the \"Sneaking inverts chopping\" setting.\n\n#### 4. How do I keep from chopping my house down?\nThere's a setting to disable chopping if the \"tree\" is not connected to leaves. Press n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle \"trees must have leaves\".\n\n#### 5. I started chopping my house down. How do I stop?\nIf you find yourself chopping a block when you just wanted to break it normally, try breaking the block while sneaking, or toggle off chopping (press n to access the settings screen).\n\n#### 6. I was chopping something and the game crashed! What's up with that?\nProbably the item you used to chop the tree doesn't play nice with TreeChop. Go to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and add the item's registry name to choppingToolsBlacklist, or ask the server owner to, and then maybe let me know about the conflict and I'll try to fix it.\n\n#### 7. Why can't I chop anymore?\nMaybe chopping is turned off; press n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle on the \"chopping\" setting. If chopping is enabled and changing tools doesn't help, then there might be a conflict with another mod. If you send me a recent log, I'll try to fix it.\n\n#### 8. Why do some trees leave behind floating leaves when felled?\nEither\na) it's a modded tree and its leaves are not set up properly. Let me know what type of tree is misbehaving, and I'll politely inform the mod owners.\nb) there are too many leaves! You can increase the max number of leaves by going to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and increasing maxLeavesBlocks.\n\n#### 9. Why do some trees leave behind floating logs when felled?\nEither\na) it's a modded tree and is weirdly shaped. Let me know, and I'll try to make TreeChop do a better job of detecting that type of tree.\nb) the tree is too big! You can increase the max tree size by going to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and increasing maxTreeBlocks.\n\n#### 10. How do I disable mushroom and fungus chopping?\nGo to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and change\n    blockTagForDetectingLogs = \"treechop:choppables\"\nto\n    blockTagForDetectingLogs = \"treechop:choppables_except_mushrooms\"\nIf you want more control over which blocks can be chopped, you have to make your own datapack and fiddle with the block tags (see https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag for more info).\n\n#### 12. Why am I not seeing the [fill in the blank] feature?\nOnly the newest version of Minecraft 1.16 is fully supported. Some older versions, especially 1.12.2, lack some of the fancier features.\n\n#### 11. Can I include this in a modpack?\nYes!\n\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Sample configs:</summary>\n\n<details><summary>treechop-common.toml</summary>\n\n```toml\n[permissions]\n\n\t[permissions.choppingEnabled]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.fellingEnabled]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.sneakBehavior]\n\t\tcanBeNone = true\n\t\tcanBeInvertFelling = true\n\t\tcanBeInvertChopping = true\n\n\t[permissions.treeMustHaveLeaves]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.chopInCreativeMode]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n[general]\n\t#If false, log items will be destroyed when chopping\n\tdropLootForChoppedBlocks = true\n\n[treeDetection]\n\t#Maximum number of log blocks that can be detected to belong to one tree\n\t#Range: 1 ~ 8096\n\tmaxTreeBlocks = 320\n\t#Maximum number of leaves blocks that can destroyed when a tree is felled\n\t#Range: 1 ~ 8096\n\tmaxLeavesBlocks = 1024\n\t#Destroy leaves when a tree is felled\n\tbreakLeaves = true\n\t#Non-decayable leaves are ignored when detecting leaves\n\tignorePersistentLeaves = true\n\t#Maximum distance from log blocks to destroy non-standard leaves blocks (e.g. mushroom caps) when felling\n\t#Range: 0 ~ 16\n\tmaxBreakLeavesDistance = 7\n\n\t[treeDetection.logs]\n\t\t#Blocks that should be considered choppable\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\tblocks = [\"#treechop:choppables\", \"#minecraft:logs\", \"#forge:mushroom_stems\"]\n\t\t#Blocks that should never be chopped, even if included in the list above\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\texceptions = [\"minecraft:bamboo\"]\n\n\t[treeDetection.leaves]\n\t\t#Blocks that should be considered leaves\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\tblocks = [\"#treechop:leaves_like\", \"#minecraft:leaves\", \"#minecraft:wart_blocks\", \"#forge:mushroom_caps\", \"minecraft:shroomlight\"]\n\t\t#Blocks that should never be considered leaves, even if included in the list above\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\texceptions = []\n\n[chopCounting]\n\t#Method to use for computing the number of chops needed to fell a tree\n\t#Allowed Values: LINEAR, LOGARITHMIC\n\talgorithm = \"LOGARITHMIC\"\n\t#How to round the number of chops needed to fell a tree;

This fork will be obsolete if [this PR](https://github.com/hancin/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/pull/27) is merged.\n\nThis fixes the bug where the window is not resizable after exiting fullscreen. This is a bug in LWJGL, and is fixed by [Fullscreen Fix](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-fix) and in current versions of Forge. However, the existing fixes are not applied to Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless), so this fork fixes it in that mod.\n\nSee the original Github post by Brycey92 [here](https://github.com/Brycey92/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/releases/tag/1.6.0-1).\n\nThe 1.12.2 build had the following links: [Source](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft), [Issues](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/issues)\n\n**The 1.12.2 build is licensed under the following license:**\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2017, David Larochelle-Pratte\\\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\\\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1\\.

The **current season** is defined by the **world time** (using `/time set 0` will reset to day 1 of spring). Each season has its own changes; during the spring, biomes will mostly try to match their original characteristics.\n\nThe mod has 2 components:\n- **Server:** If installed on the server biomes will have different temperatures. (this enables weather changes like snowing and block freezing in the winter). The server component also contains seasonal crops, allowing crops to grow at different speeds according to the season.\n- **Client:** If installed on the client biomes will have different colormaps according to the current season. This is just a visual change and it'll not physically impact your world in any form.\n\nTo get the full experience it's recommended that you install the mod on both the server and the client.\n\n### Seasonal Biomes\n\nBiomes have **different temperatures** depending on the current **season**:\n\n- Cold Biomes will have rain in the summer\n- Temperate Biomes will have snow in the winter\n- Tropical Biomes will have a steady season all year round\n- Hot Biomes will have a rainy season in the winter\n\nDepending on the **original** temperature/precipitation of the **biome**, this behavior can change. \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NdYBkgC.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gH5seb5.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Qs600XR.gif\">\n</center>\n\n### Seasonal Crops\n\nCrops will grow at **different speeds** depending on the current **season**.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/75gqPqS.png\">\n</center>\n\nEach **individual crop** will have a **pre-configured** growth **speed** for one of the four seasons, this is controlled by a **datapack** and can be changed by the user if they want.\n\n<center>\n<img

The biome consists in patches of mud and jungle grass, a lush green grass that can spread to mud blocks and keeps the same green color in all biomes.\n\nThe temple is a rare structure full of traps found in the underground jungle. Every temple has a treasure chest and a temple key that you need to open the treasure chest. The treasure chest will contain one tool from the temple set. These tools can mine every block in the vanilla game, they are faster than any vanilla tool, and they cannot be destroyed by explosions, but they have a lower durability.\n\nJungle zombies can spawn in the underground jungle biome and mossy skeletons can spawn inside the temple. Both these mobs can inflict the poison effect to players if they are hit.\n\n### Main mod page\n\nCurseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/underground-jungle\n\nModrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/underground-jungle\n\nIf you find this mod on other distribution platforms, these are NOT managed by me.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe fabric version of the mod requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n\n### Check out my other mods\n\n* [Spider Caves](https://modrinth.com/mod/spider-caves): Adds a spider cave biome and a spider armor\n\n## Questions and answers\n\n**Q**: Can I use this in my modpack?\n\n**A**: Yes.

Lederhosen, shirts, Dirndl\n* New Building Blocks, new Food Blocks, new decorative Elements - All in the Style of the Oktoberfest\n<br>\n… and more\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n\n__Getting started__\n<br>\n<br>\n__Drying__\nOne of the basic ingredients for beer and whiskey is dried corn, wheat, or barley. To obtain this, you need a drying silo. Gather the corn, wheat, or barley, open the hatch of the silo with a skillful left-click (you need both hands for this! So make sure they are both empty!) and throw it into the silo. The silo connects in a 2x2 or 3x3 grid and can be extended up to a maximum height of 9. The larger the silo, the greater the capacity and the faster the drying\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Brewing__\nGreat job with the drying! Next up is the Brewing Station. To start the brewing process, you still need more ingredients. In most cases, hops, water, and coal. What? Coal in beer? No, no - it serves a different purpose. Let's take a normal wheat beer as an example: Throw two sacks of dried wheat and some hops into the brew kettle, fill it with water, and you're almost there. You've probably already noticed that the brew kettle is a bit larger and consists of several parts - now go to the part with the stove and fire it up with the coal. That's it!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Brewing Process__\nThe brewing process lasts several seconds and requires your attention. Several small events occur at different parts of the Brewing Station, such as:\nThe furnace loses heat and requires more coal\nThe brewing kettle overheats; remove some water\n... and more to figure out \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Hops?__\nHops can be found in Taigas. Yes - even in those from [insert any Worldgen Mod that uses the #is_taiga tag here]. To grow hops, you need a somewhat elaborate construction: Build two fence posts with a height of three blocks (or more - higher is always better!) and connect them with a rope. Then you can plant the hops at the lowest point of the rope on farmland. Of course, you can also use the ropes for other things: fences, railings - let your creativity run wild! :)\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Hops?__\nHops can be found in Taigas.

The armor pieces are sold by villagers. You can either find them at the Brew Festival or you can provide them with a Bar Counter to work at. One part of the armor set cannot be purchased and must be obtained in another way - but I'll leave it to you to figure that out.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFeeling lost?

handful of additions to vanilla Nether biomes","body":"### 🔥 About\n**Hearths** is a light data pack that adds new features and structures to the vanilla Nether. It improves three vanilla biomes: the Nether Wastes, the Crimson Forest, and the Warped Forest. It also adds two new structures: the Crimson and Warped Towers.\n\n### 📦 Content\n\nThe **Nether Wastes** were mainly upgraded with two new features - netherrack spikes (or rather stalagmites and stalactites) as well as blackstone and magma 'lakes'. This transforms the wastes into less of a desert-like biome and more of a hostile cave-like biome.\n\nThe **Crimson Forest** and the **Warped Forest** now include blackstone rocks, fallen fungus stems, and a new, weird type of sprawling huge fungus.

Intended for use with a season mod.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- **Snow recalculation** upon chunk loading. No more winter chunks in the summer!\n- **Changing day cycle duration** depending on the season. Longer nights in the winter.\n\n### Compatibility\n\nThe following season mods are supported:\n\n- [Serene Seasons (Forge)][1]\n  - A special hook is used as it does not actually modify the biome temperature method but rather modifies all vanilla code that uses it.\n- [Fabric Seasons (Fabric)][2]\n  - Full compatibility out of the box without special tricks\n\n_**Hourglass integration requires Forge and Serene Seasons.**_ It will overwrite your `daySpeed` and `nightSpeed` to\nmatch the current season, however you can set a `hourglassDaySpeed` / `hourglassNightSpeed` in the configuration file if\nyou wish. If you want, you can disable it entirely in the configuration. (Hourglass for 1.16.5 is on CurseForge)\n\n### Performance\n\nIn 1.1.0, performance was significantly increased by only updating blocks when they need an update (i.e. grass blocks).\nAlso, call to `Biome.shouldFreeze` has been removed, as it was a major source of lag and always returned false anyway.\n\nAs a coarse benchmark (totally unscientific), after flying around and generating chunks in Creative, the mod only used\n0.99% of the Server Thread according to Spark Profiler.\n\n### Future Plans\n\n- Water freezing (current implementation causes massive lag and doesn't work)\n- Making leaves & grass white (Like Bedrock Edition)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis mod is a remake of my private mod BetterSereneSeasons, which was originally a 1.19.2 Forge remake of [Serene Tweaks][4].\n\n[1]: https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/serene-seasons\n[2]: https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-seasons\n[3]: https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hourglass\n[4]:

Meadow is a mid sized Minecraft Mod which focuses on improving and overhauling the already existing Meadow Biome. It also expands the variety of animals by adding the almost lost ones from Minecraft:Earth. \n\nTo get some energy for exploring the new Biome you should definitely take some Cheese with you - crafting cheese is another feature Meadow brings. Oh - and consider bringing a weapon; we heard some aggressive Brown Bears walking around there.\n\n\n\n \n__Features__\n* A new crafting system for Cheese\n* The Meadow Biome got completely overhauled. It features now some smaller building, a forest area, clearing and vegetation\n* New Animal-Breeds for Cows, Cattles, Chickens, Bears and Sheeps…\n* With new Sheeps and Cattles theres also new Wool, Carpets and Beds \n* You can now get Milk from Goats, Sheeps, Buffalos… Wont spoil to much!\n* Lots of decorative blocks \n* New Armor\n* A few new paintings featuring some popular places in switzerland \n* Tired of farming bricks for flower pots? You can craft now wooden flower pots. Coming in 2 different sizes. \n* A new type of wood\n* A new type of stone\n* A lot of new flowers!\n* Lots of technical Blocks which will help you saving resources and time just like a Woodcutter\n \n \n\n__How to craft Cheese?__\nTo craft Cheese you will need following Ingredients: Salt, Rennet and Milk. You can find Alpine Salt everywhere underground in the new Meadow Biomes. Rennet can be extracted from Raw Beef, using a cooking pot and Salt. Different Milk will result in different Cheese. \n \n \n\n__Where do i find all these new Type of Sheeps?__\nFlecked and Patched Sheeps can be found nearly everywhere where a regular Sheep will spawn too. Fuzzy Sheeps can mostly be found in Dark Forest or Birch Forest Biomes. Horned Sheeps do like cold biomes: If there is snow your chance finding a Horned Sheep will be certainly higher. Rocky Sheeps therefore can be found on rough terrain biomes. Inky Sheeps can be found in meadow biomes such as Long Nosed Sheeps. \n \n\n\n__And what about Cows?__\nYou can find Highland Cattles and Dairy Cows in the Meadow Biome. Sunset and Cream Cows as well as Buffalos can mostly be found in warm biomes such as the Savanna, Savanna Plateau. If you're looking especially for Buffalos just keep an eye on water resources. Cookie and Umbra Cows can be found in Forests and all the other Cows do share Spawn Locations with Vanilla Cows. \nAnything special about these cows? Buffalo Milk can only be optained from Buffalos. Umbra and Highland Cattles can be sheared.\n \n\n\n\n \nMeadow should be compatible with most WorldGen Mods such as WiliamWythersOverhauledOverworld or Terralith. Since all of Meadows Leaves do have a „bushy“ Model it wont work with fast leaves - better turn it off in the option settings. \n \n \n\n  \n \nDedicated to MissLilitu","published":"2023-03-05T09:52:04.270634Z","updated":"2024-07-26T07:53:29.081817Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":359108,"followers":316,"categories":["decoration","food","mobs"],"additional_categories":["equipment","game-mechanics","utility","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["F6B5mfRf","pzwIWuWk","4fXhdDoQ","WkhBbeX5","LzYs6y96","CkvEEK6t","s9fp3dqT","M5z80GON","RvotVuwM","7OLeMPXR","Lczsh0Tb","syG35Dbz","QHqnFZCQ","s6iyZ11j","qc3u5IYp","B40ZoBd3","gYJpMo0X","aXV0hfvS","Pu0t9Z0M","uC0K8G0t","OmVA6sCj","XL2U0NKa","v1hn114Z","Y9yHNxAC","Nt1llZAE","Gy9GZdeb","6oiSzkVl","RLVanW9D","m81jLF8f","miNXaly0","iMeun2EO","23ZVhkqv","zSqFSECe","utdA1qC8","jLvkPR0R","ocw1sdZn","ZRcG1Qlu","18qqlnfw","GtlTsR51","LQ0bjhkL","pGx09Lpw","47NDcBIM","bbDfR1Os","O3PNP7F7","B80G8xT0","Qt2lCIS5","UZTOvIXW"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ra7o6Sl7/b26237c7cae39914233fb470328b9d23474dd799.png"},"version":{"id":"Qt2lCIS5","project_id":"ra7o6Sl7","author_id":"u5d114le","featured":false,"name":"[Let's Do] Meadow 1.3.19","version_number":"1.3.19","changelog":"# Meadow 1.3.19 \n* Fixed the \"Find Meadow\" Advancement\n* You can now use Wooden Buckets on a Candlelight Sink","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-07-26T07:53:03.288497Z","downloads":26841,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"fc1f2cec6b5210829fb9c4db5324f7b6a633aed44f964e86ae5469e7b3296945386c92b6f7e8c01cb066eaa44dc42c8efcb61c85e2176acaae9809a52ba73baf","sha1":"13350b5784ffc059dc1ce1a117af9939ed05ad3f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ra7o6Sl7/versions/Qt2lCIS5/letsdo-meadow-fabric-1.3.19.jar","filename":"letsdo-meadow-fabric-1.3.19.jar","primary":true,"size":2645493,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"4XJZeZbM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"lhGA9TYQ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Go8fGgLS","user":{"id":"g7PU4vft","username":"IamJannik","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104758303?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-06-18T14:31:59.745426Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"Go8fGgLS","user":{"id":"3tNWgp1O","username":"Cristelknight","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54945257?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-03T10:38:22.510785Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"Go8fGgLS","user":{"id":"u5d114le","username":"satisfyu","name":"mrclb - Marco","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104036234?v=4","bio":"Hey!","created":"2022-12-25T20:25:04.521571Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"letsdo-meadow-fabric-1.3.19.jar"},"mods\\fpapmod-2.2.0-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"6a150f0b7e64bf9835a0348bdcce73bb3c1da64ddd77ff66a59acef4d1a6ad889f7627decced63d676b9e0544fd8447efd00f0ed16fa1153263c0febd3993521","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"PjK1ZOiw","slug":"fallen-paladins-and-priests","project_type":"mod","team":"2wcRbJ4Q","title":"Fallen Paladins and Priests [More Magic Series]","description":"Heal your allies and pursuit your dark ambitions!","body":"# 📦 Installation\n### Required\n- AzureLib Armor\n- Runes\n- Spell Engine\n### Strongly recommended\n- Better Combat for proper weapon mechanics\n- Paladins & Priests: what is darkness whitout a light to conquer it?

visible. [Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com//partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-06-14T21:20:00.112947Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":11411390,"followers":6087,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon","bketoxVs","frGGaFrx","gO8hxcyv","ugIRhLoi","2LyjkgAv","PG8gMKcT","4Nq7hEtl","hyejM5za","SzEdoick","UHcskdEO","92bPVm5F","DHBIGCNn","F3RXDl1W","TOyoOLwn","7ZgGD02s","KRGWwoZW","1LVdHUaX","3VAtIiWX","cj8nR3eG","VgDjay7P","p2L3IXut","6U5rh26a","Gggee1My","LXLEbjiC","Bu3hSiJb"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"F3RXDl1W","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.6-1.20.1 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.6","changelog":"## Changes\r\n* Update to 1.21\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.5...1.6.6","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-14T21:18:59.608009Z","downloads":502882,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d6894508d74e5f01fb525b5b89d20ac4e54257b6","sha512":"1e272086c2a63bfaba910d98d1d048629d1f22a953b0caaf7349fd75ec6c80f17219cc67d938c7524d2bade2c0074117091237184f7bf72f30989294f84af66e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/F3RXDl1W/entityculling-fabric-1.6.6-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-fabric-1.6.6-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":66648,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"poie5Iwy","username":"vicisacat","name":"vicisacat","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/poie5Iwy/107197d35f2df9a1b4f3f2c09ccbe65a1df9bd82.png","bio":"I made the Entity Culling port for beta 1.7.3 and that's it.

This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder. Currently, the command will scan crafting,\nsmelting, blasting, smoking, and smithing recipes.\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n","published":"2023-02-03T20:08:37.444573Z","updated":"2024-07-21T02:03:36.448315Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1597062,"followers":511,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["diy4s2XO","66Bkdq05","68l9BR3j","bT9w3gh5","hR8YtS8a","gxwQtnsA","vAv92Cl4","vuRsKlbz","cnPRpn78","tLFw14o5","haoNzeyv","750iJ3hO","rect6WEh","aYxyXMzJ","ChHxCoAb","STYYlkp8","wN8G3kAN","skUakdXR","uAleZkbS","SNlci35k","GKZ6KVfs","6Nyu412V","VQtXcHcR","bIDSNOm5","UlRasi89","l15iQHMn","AWwJD7yS","7L5hC81R","zncS6GGa","pJZr4yc3","8zhVFKEL","Sj0OPjRM","2BAp032A","FBfg7una","E4b6m0sQ","GcFD377O","km82tZAr","gXWxJGsW","Y8yR5ZhZ","qA4syOxx","akZJjqpV","iaqnjwBU","6tFcWl5d","Mq4la1Hv","W3ii0PIQ","N1NUMRCn","89IAarqG","ByjYK8ay","EYWxtHOI","V6TZ8mE6","OQP0nLJU","R9HsHDwY","GTEspIbt","wZ1N91Ci","yPIvYQkJ","QoURX3fY","3RJxqsNz","p4JIL4TF","3XAwKo9y","HpXWxhc2","WNLgny3d","9XFy7cdd","xGn4rwXN","USDMEIVG","xaTRylMN","XnckJfxp","CJo9qCQT","7HrMDnJs","lvXLiyLU","pT1H26Vj","p7pF15m3","9dCd6h4k","JJzyheLt","e9bcrAwa","Uxso6lX6","6kZfluud","q2Fuq2OB","PwXImdZm","qm2ho2dd","vS0MDXGK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/ed244c5829bde539763c7fffb55cb3194a349d66.png"},"version":{"id":"EYWxtHOI","project_id":"tagwiZkJ","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"polymorph-fabric-0.49.5+1.20.1","version_number":"0.49.5+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios.

addon providing support for the Fabric Rendering API, based on Indigo","body":"Indium is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), providing support for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2024-08-15T17:24:30.310929Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":9035397,"followers":7272,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC","nTorcOMQ","Aouse6P7","VlLxDisa","XPsoVC5n","w4F7PG0f","gofbpynL","K4hsdO9H","Z8VpxxGh"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"gofbpynL","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.34 for Minecraft 1.20.x/Sodium 0.5.11","version_number":"1.0.34+mc1.20.1","changelog":"- Bump version again (comp500)\n- Update to Sodium 0.5.11 (comp500)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.34+mc1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-07-01T18:31:58.292934Z","downloads":440344,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"15bb1be71ee8c0455804d38b0e735ce1cd72b6a65ce78199b227dd4806a7726fd5fcf44ea60b382b5d97546c693d289c64f7ef872701ee1ddf1ddab14f2cee74","sha1":"a2de9ba15f155b09626995ad58b0e23803b05fe6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/gofbpynL/indium-1.0.34%2Bmc1.20.1.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.34+mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":105359,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"ygf8cVZg","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.34+mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\immersive_aircraft-1.0.1+1.20.1-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"ca519251caa0c2d7f9900e72092ac133c3fad2ade8f93a33ab0a7247ce014aeabd4012020640e44ecc84329ee20ecbe9692831c8c03d04e1047b472239e8720b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"x3HZvrj6","slug":"immersive-aircraft","project_type":"mod","team":"lVzmYLvB","title":"Immersive Aircraft","description":"A bunch of rustic aircraft to travel, transport, and explore!","body":"# Immersive Aircraft\n\nThis mod adds bunch of rustic aircraft to travel, transport, and explore!\nThe aircraft have a strong focus on being vanilla-faithful and many details and functionalities, without being overly complicated.\n\n## Addons\n* [Man of Many Planes](https://modrinth.com/mod/man-of-many-planes)\n\nOh and look, multiplayer compatible!\n\n![Multiplayer](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/4a1359df6f2febedd25b255fe90107dcd78c70a8.jpeg)\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Biplane\n\nLet's start with the classic biplane.

If you cant find any a Wandering Winemaker will make visit from time to time maybe offering some seeds. You can get seeds by eating Grapes.\nAfter harvesting your first Grapes can either just eat them or put them into a Pot and crush them by jumping and walking around in it. Then you can extract Grapejuice by using Empty Winebottles. Filled Winebottles can be refined in a Barrel by using extra Ingredients such as Sweetberries, Honey and so on. Different sort of Grapejuice and Ingredients result in different Wine. \n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nThere are actually 4 different varieties of Grapes available: \nLight, Heavy, vigorous and resilient. Each of them are found in different biomes and will affect your wines different. For example: You can find resilient Grapes mostly in Jungle Biomes and you can craft mostly Wines with the ability to heal with it. Heavy Grapes are found in cold Biomes; such as Taiga or Old Growth Pine Forests. Most Wines crafted with heavy Grapes will give you the ability to increase your Protection. \nHaving troubles finding Grapes or Seeds? A Wandering Winemaker will visit you from time to time - he might offer Seeds for a few Emeralds. \n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nFeeling lost? There are some built-in recipe Books which will show you some recipes or potential Ingredients.

Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly.

Can be configured to either decelerate or accelerate the rate at which crops receive random ticks where they have a chance to grow. Can be configured with _Cloth Config_ from the in-game mod menu. Originally motivated by \"Let Them Grow\" by Lothrazar which is not available for Fabric.\n\n## 🎁 Thanks\n\nIf you enjoy high effort, high quality video essays, take a peek at my YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/@SaintJulesDay](https://www.youtube.com/@SaintJulesDay).\n\n## 🪐 Features\n\nCrop blocks in Minecraft receive random ticks and internally roll on if the crop should grow into its next maturity state. This mod hooks into the `randomTick` method of `CropBlock` and rolls an additional time to determine if the tick should go through or be prevented. When set to a tick chance of `0.5`, only half of all random ticks sent to a crop block would go through and it should grow only half as quickly.\n\nThe mod also allows separately configuring the growth stages applied to a crop block, e.g. with the use of bonemeal by a player or automation and changing the amount of growth stages applied whenever growth happens by any means. Additionally, the mod supports scheduling extra rolls for the crop to allow for more than one chance to mature.\n\n### 🌵 Slower Natural Growth\n\nTo slow down crop growth in your world, configure crop tick chance (`cropTickChance`) to a value below the default `1.0` (unaltered/vanilla growth speed). Setting it to `0.5` will let crops grow at roughly 50% the speed of vanilla, `0.25` at 25% the speed of vanilla, and so on.\n\nTo decrease the stages a crop grows per successful event, you can lower `cropGrowthAmountMin` from its vanilla value to `1` and `cropGrowthAmountMax` from to `4` or `3`. Changing these values is not required.\n\n### 🌾 Faster Natural Growth\n\nTo speed up crop growth, leave crop tick chance (`cropTickChance`) at its default `1.0` and increase the chance for extra rolls (`cropExtraRollChance`). Setting it to `0.5` means that half the times a crop might grow, it gets another chance to grow again, giving you a cumulative of 75%.\n\nTo additionally increase the stages a crop grows per successful event, you can increase both crop growth minimums and maximums (`cropGrowthAmountMin` and `cropGrowthAmountMax`) from their vanilla values, though total growth is limited by the maximum number of stages supported by a crop. Changing these values is not required.\n\nConsider configuring a limit on how many extra rolls can happen via max extra rolls (`cropExtraRollMax`). Setting the extra roll chance to `1.0` causes another tick to be scheduled for every single tick that occurs, so a limit is recommended to prevent infinite growth.\n\n### 🦴 Reduced Bonemeal Growth\n\nTo reduce the chance of using bonemeal growing a crop, you can reduce the crop growth chance (`cropGrowthChance`). A value of `1.0` (the vanilla setting) means every time bonemeal is used, a random growth stage is applied to the block. This option can also be used to disable bonemeal crop growth entirely when set to `0.0`.\n\n## ⚖️ License\n\nThis mod was created by Saint for free use by the Minecraft community under the MIT license.

own and its only purpose is to act as a dependency for other mods that use its features.\n\n## About\n\nMelody is an OpenAL-based client-side library mod for playing background music.<br>\nIt allows you to use OpenAL in Minecraft separated from Minecraft's sound engine and manager.\n\nMelody allows you to (asynchronously) load audio files from all kinds of sources, including web sources.\n\nIt has built-in support for OGG and WAV audio files, but there's nothing stopping you from extending it to support more file types!\n\nTo get an idea of how to create ready-to-play audio sources, take a look at Melody's [`SimpleAudioFactory`](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody/blob/1.20.1/common/src/main/java/de/keksuccino/melody/resources/audio/SimpleAudioFactory.java) class!\n\nEverything important is documented in the source, so make sure to take a look at [Melody's source on GitHub](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody)!\n\n## Copyright & Licensing\n\nMelody Copyright © 2023 Keksuccino.<br>\nMelody is licensed under MIT.\n\n## Server Needed?\n\nYou need a Minecraft server to play with your friends but it's just too much work to setup one on your own?<br>\nNo problem, just rent an ready-to-use server and start playing in a snap!\n\nJust click on the image below and use the code **keksuccino** to get **25% off** your first month!\n\n<a

For Forge, it's available for 1.12.2, 1.16.5, 1.18, 1.19 and 1.20!</p>\n<h4><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h4>\n<p>Q. How do I get support?<br>A. You can check out my Discord (linked below) or alternatively create an issue on our GitHub, which can be found by clicking on \"Issues\" above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. What versions does Lootr support?<br>A. Currently, Lootr for Forge supports the following versions: 1.18, 1.19/1.19.1/1.19.2, 1.19.3. Please check the \"All Files\" page if you cannot find a download for the version of Minecraft you are playing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. Is there a server-only version? Can I connect without installing it on the client?<br>A. No, <strong>Lootr is currently required on both the client and the server</strong>. If you have experience with plug-in development and are willing to help design a server-only version, please reach out on Discord (link found below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. How do I change what loot is generated with Lootr? How do I include loot from other mods in Lootr containers?<br>A. <strong>This is beyond the scope of the Lootr mod</strong>, which simply changes the containers. In all other respects, loot is generated in exactly the same way as Vanilla chests generate it. Modifying loot tables is generally done via data packs, although various mods exist for various versions of Minecraft which do this. I recommend asking in your favourite modded Minecraft Discord or forum!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. What about dungeon mods? How do I prevent players from going in and looting everything after it has already been cleared?<br>A. There are a number of options that help with this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specific loot tables can be blacklisted, which means that those chests will never be converted. You can also specify simply all loot tables of a certain mod. Likewise, specific dimensions can be blacklisted.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, you can specify for certain containers (or all containers), determined by their loot table, to \"decay\". This means that a configurable time after they are first opened, the next time someone attempts to open the container, the block will be destroyed. There also exists the opposite, a system whereby chests will \"refresh\" (or re-generate their contents) after the configured period of time has elapsed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. How do I prevent players from simply breaking containers?<br>A. By default, players who attempt to break a container will be given a warning message and a reminder that all containers are available per-player. Players can still break these containers by doing so while sneaking, unless this option is disabled in the configuration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. I don't like the visual appearance of the containers. How can I change this?<br>A. There is a client-side option that forces containers to use the default Vanilla skin. However, this does mean there is no visual change to indicate if a container has been opened before.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. Can I add Lootr to a pre-existing world and have containers be converted?<br>A. Yes! With one disclaimer: <strong>loot containers which were already opened will not be converted</strong>. The generation of loot in Minecraft, by default, removes the associated loot table, and there is no way for Lootr to find this information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. The container from &lt;random mod&gt; isn't converting!<br>A. If the container contains items (or always contains the same items), it is possible that the mod is manually generating loot for it. In this case, there is no way for Lootr to determine a loot table and convert chests. I recommend asking the author of the mod to consider switching to a loot table instead to maintain compatibility! If the container is empty, it is possible that it is merely included for the aesthetic. Otherwise, if you believe there's an issue with conversion, please open an issue on our GitHub tracker or post on Discord. Additional methods for converting containers exist for 1.12.2.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that the \"axe chest\" in the Vanilla Woodland Mansion does not have an associated loot table and is never converted.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. I no longer want Lootr. What happens if I remove it?<br>A. <strong>Unfortunately, removing the mod will also remove all Lootr containers</strong>. There is currently no way to undo the conversion process.&nbsp;This means that every Lootr converted container will be removed from your world.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. I want to create a \"starter\" chest with some items in it for everyone in my world, how do I go about this? How do I create my own Lootr container?<br>A. Lootr also contains \"custom\" inventories which use the same visual appearance as a chest. Simply create a Vanilla chest, fill it with the items you want available and then, while standing on it, execute the&nbsp;/lootr custom&nbsp;command (this requires operator privileges).&nbsp;<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. What else does the&nbsp;/lootr command do?<br>A. For a full explanation of the command, please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/noobanidus/Lootr/wiki/Lootr-command\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lootr Command page on our GitHub Wiki</a>.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. How do I use Lootr in a mod pack, or how do I natively use Lootr in my Mod?<br>A. For a full explanation of Lootr's features for mod packs, as well as the Lootr API, please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/noobanidus/Lootr/wiki/Lootr-for-Developers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lootr for Developers page on our GitHub Wiki</a>.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q.

For a full explanation of Lootr's configuration, please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/noobanidus/Lootr/wiki/Lootr-Configuration\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lootr Configuration page on our GitHub Wiki</a>.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q.

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.dev/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

But it will fit even better in a medieval world, with mods and add-ons from the past, and thus live an unforgettable gaming experience. The buildings are full of enemies, but also traps or valuable treasures, so visiting them can be of great help at some points in the game, although in others it can mean death...\n\n![FAQ](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/MB/BH_MB_BANNER2.webp)\n\n### Is it compatible with other mods that add structures?\n### \nWithout a doubt, it is perfectly compatible with any other mod, both structures and biomes. Although in the latter, they will only appear in biomes with characteristics similar to those initially established.\n\n### Where can the new structures be found?\n### \nSome of them can appear in any biome in the game, such as towers. While others, such as large towns, will only appear in the grasslands (to avoid deformations of the terrain). Of course, ships will appear in the oceans.\n\n### Does it work on servers?\n### \nSure! Remember that the best way to play with mods and friends is with BisectHosting, and by **[clicking on this link you can get a 25% discount](https://bisecthosting.com/lupin).**\n\n### Can this mod be used in modpacks?\n### \nOf course!

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

this shader pack\n\n### Features\n\n* Fully revamped sky, lighting and water with a cohesive visual style\n* Immersive weather system with different skies each day, featuring multiple volumetric cloud layers\n* Colored lighting using a voxel flood-fill algorithm (enabled with Ultra profile, requires Iris)\n* Full labPBR resource pack support\n* Extensive settings menu allowing you to customize every aspect of the shader\n* Screen-space reflections\n* Volumetric lighting\n* Soft shadows with variable penumbra size\n* High quality ambient occlusion (GTAO)\n* Camera effects: bloom, depth of field, motion blur\n* Much improved image quality with TAA, FXAA and CAS\n* Advanced temporal upscaling (disabled by default) for low end devices\n\n### Compatibility\n\n* Photon can be used with [Iris](https://irisshaders.dev/download) (recommended) or [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/home) on Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs\n* Iris is a modern shader loader with far better performance, mod compatibility and developer features than OptiFine. Some features (Colored Lighting) will only work on Iris\n* Photon is also compatible with [Distant Horizons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/distant-horizons) (as of writing this requires a special version of Iris and Distant Horizons which is available in the Iris installer)\n\n### Showcase videos\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vxE_CVeU8Rs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

Each ship has an evoker. illagers will continuously spawn on these until you kill all the evokers.

If an illager is in the water, it will get into a boat and patrol nearby ocean. If it sees an enemy, it will stop patrolling and chase it. Ships spawn with a few patrols around to make getting on board more challenging. Fleets spawn with even more patrols around them.\n\n**The Illager boat mechanic is experimental, can be somewhat performance intensive, and might break if you have mods, plugins, or other datapacks installed!**\nIf you need to disable or limit Ai boats, you can do so by changing gamerules with \"/function ships:gamerules\"  \nIf you are interested in helping optimize the datapack, you can contribute [here](https://github.com/EMD0123/Ships/pulls).\n\n![Alt text](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/M185nxi6/images/d0909c5defc9ace3c2521b579df1fcf2556ab7a6.png 'Pillager in a boat')\n---\n\n\nTo use this datapack/mod in a modpack outside of Modrinth, you must comment on its Planet Minecraft page that you are using this datapack/mod in a modpack and include either a link to the modpack in the comment, or both its name and a link to the website it's hosted on in the comment.\n\nCredit to Bobydon for the showcase video.","published":"2023-08-23T15:32:52.488447Z","updated":"2024-07-15T23:24:49.318721Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":112072,"followers":171,"categories":["adventure","mobs","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["eHhAvITk","fCvd1DA6","uJRnoZaC","FogpnwlQ","LzWjr0HE","fV7eyxMz","aQS87m4k","f8wQ4T1z","jg4SpGeC","pvnZwUdi","kJC4a0Hk","nsNIMxs5","9sRKlllo","yOeyP5p5","dgNofiqr","xmbECuEZ","qD0w21Oo"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/M185nxi6/e32b82a92cb7074ca3c7e2371f3870bb273dd37a.png"},"version":{"id":"qD0w21Oo","project_id":"M185nxi6","author_id":"anoqh8a9","featured":false,"name":"3.0.3 [Mod]","version_number":"3.0.3+mod","changelog":"Support for 1.20.2/3/4/5/6 and 1.21.0","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-07-15T23:24:50.263372Z","downloads":25398,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"8b23ab0991c988fb3bd1c29e97c5a005d4a82750f29668cb5cdd3f9273d4b7aeca4d1ee7142bca2f5dca53524417001949749302b62956d90b387beda5afcfd5","sha1":"ff5a5aee5cf073cb66f565f314e5d71fe4418d2f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/M185nxi6/versions/qD0w21Oo/ships-3.0.3.jar","filename":"ships-3.0.3.jar","primary":true,"size":493126,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"HXiaHqtb","user":{"id":"anoqh8a9","username":"EMD123","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105021395?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-02-07T22:06:08.086530Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ships-3.0.3.jar"},"mods\\tiered-1.3.3.jar":{"sha512":"dcd53a96a74447375e68e3d22a1a7d008fef66dbaafe77035c61b2b7b2ba75f92d509b33c492688aa71ba8d7c5649061e82359d764c52947fed268de5015210f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"z6sMEexp","slug":"tieredz","project_type":"mod","team":"IkGpiU4D","title":"TieredZ","description":"Adds tiers/modifiers to tools","body":"![Headline](https://i.imgur.com/gb6pPeJ.png)\n\n<center>\n\n[<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/745451299713056791?color=7289DA&label=DISCORD&logo=discord&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge\">](https://discord.gg/cV4cJyGXqF) \n[<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/website?color=7bc466&label=Globox&style=for-the-badge&up_message=Wiki&url=https://globox1997.github.io/wiki/mods/TieredZ/\">](https://globox1997.github.io/wiki/mods/TieredZ/)\n[<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Globox1997/tiered?color=c4667b&style=for-the-badge\">](https://github.com/Globox1997/tiered/issues)\n</center>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/K0Bn3Mh.png\" alt= “Description” width=\"25%\" height=\"auto\">\n<br><br/>\n\nTiered is a Fabric mod inspired by Quality Tools.

or more entries within the tag are invalid. There will be a message found within the game if the tags are \"cooked\" and more info similar to the base game can be found within the Log of the Server/Client the mod is running.\n\nThe reason behind this mod is the issue that some mod or data pack may add an invalid entry to let's say \"minecraft:mineable/pickaxe\" leading to all pickaxe mineable blocks being unmineable which breaks the game.\n\n**TLDR:** This mod prevents Mod/Datapack mistakes from breaking entire portions of the game.

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first. More information about installing Fabric Loader can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/).\n\nThe downloaded jar file should be placed in your `mods`

The mod introduces a number of new dungeons to explore with various sizes and themes, along with a tricky boss to fight at the end of many structures. Obtain the new items to fight through a number of mobs that block your path. Reach the end of the dungeon and defeat the bosses to claim the reward and dungeon for yourself! Welcome to Dungeon Now Loading! Explore and discover, curious dungeoneers!\n\n# Goal\nOur goal is simple: to add 100 new challenging, but fair dungeons and bosses to the world of Minecraft. Minecraft is a sandbox game and players find their own way to enjoy the game, but we believe that there are players that want difficult challenges that demand more skills and knowledge from Minecraft. Our objective is to fill in that gap by adding fun challenges in the shape of dungeons and bosses, while providing more tools that the players can use to face the challenges. We update the mod regularly and every 1% increase in the percentage will be an update that adds in a new structure and boss or a significant update that changes the gameplay of the dungeons. If you are interested in joining our journey to 100%, try out our Dungeon Now Loading Mod!\n\n# \n![Discord](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/78655f8542a976bfbd438a5128706b10f95243e6.webp)\n\nWe have a friendly community in our discord and many activities going on such as:\n\n- Idea Polls\n- Update Announcements\n- Development Sneak Peek\n- Structure Suggestions\n- Checkpoint Player Head Submissions\n- Giving Feedbacks\n- Channels for Sharing Projects\n\nFeel free to stop by: \n\n**Discord Link:** [https://discord.gg/NawU3rgAhE](https://discord.gg/NawU3rgAhE)\n\n#\n![Patreon](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/d34f5f31439550656025a524cb7e51a7e8bc7db1.webp)\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B6h6pf0DuMM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nWe also have Patreon!

We want to introduce new players to atlas, and make it easier to maintain and improve.<br/>\n`0.x` uses arch, keeps the old `antiqueatlas` ID, and is API-compatible with [tyra's port](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas).<br/>\n`1.x` uses fabric, and is API-incompatible with 0.x.<br/>\n`2.x` uses fabric and [Surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor) - and is save/API/network/respack-incompatible with older versions.<br/>\n\nOnce stable and feature-complete, we intend to maintain atlas on most modpack versions >=1.18.2 ([more info](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues/81))\n\n## Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\nThe art for antique atlas was created by [Hunternif](https://github.com/Hunternif) ([DA](https://www.deviantart.com/hunternif)) and [lumiscosity](https://github.com/lumiscosity) ([Neocities](https://lumiscosity.neocities.org/)).<br/>\n[Click here](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/credits.txt) for detailed art credit.\n\nThis mod is a fourth-gen rewrite, and relies heavily on contributions of many developers and artists before us.<br/>\nWe can't draw autotile to save our lives - feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atexturing)!\n\nThis mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt Plus](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) -

Once you have at least 12 eyes, you can follow them until you reach the Stronghold. You have to put <strong>the 12 custom eyes in the portal in order to open it</strong>. If there's a vanilla eye of ender in one of the frames, you can remove it by right clicking on it with a custom eye.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PuRYpVn.png\" alt=\"The Eyes\" width=\"1042\" height=\"174\" /></span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Eyes are a really important part of End Remastered, just like Vanilla Ender Eyes, they allow you to activate the portal to the End. However, unlike Vanilla Ender Eyes, they are not dropped by Endermen, but must be found by exploring, fighting and mining.

To craft steel, put an iron ingot in a blast furnace.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">On the latest version you can apply a banner on armor and horse armor (just like on a shield) and dye some types of armor.

Please expect features to change and be added as development continues.*\n\n*This mod is for Fabric and Quilt. A Forge port is not planned at this time.*\n\n*All credit goes to EmilyPloszaj for the creation of EMI itself. This is just a plugin.*\n\n[![Join the Discord](https://i.imgur.com/iXATO6K.png)](https://discord.gg/zDbaYmUba2)\n[![Ronald McDonald House Donation Link](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/5f2635e02e8561eb3ae165bda17a9579841d3882.png)](https://tiltify.com/+team-timefall/team-timefall-annual-charity-2024)\n\n#### Wiki\n\nFor guides on how to use the data-driven systems in EMI Loot, please see [the wiki](https://github.com/fzzyhmstrs/EMI_loot/wiki)\n\n#### Notable Features\n\n- Chest loot is sorted by percentage and includes drops added to the loot tables by mods.\n- If a chest has too many loot options to fit onto the screen, EMI Loot will condense the output into lists of items stacked by same-percentage. Hovering over a certain percentage list will show the possible stacks you can expect to get at that probability.\n- Stack sizes shown represent the average item count you can expect to pull at a time (before factoring in the probability).\n- Block drops have been added. These views show the various drops available, split into different categories based on any particular circumstances needed to get that drop (Silk Touch, Shears, etc).\n- Mob drops have been added. Shows drops available split into categories based on circumstances needed to acquire them (only when a mob is on fire, extra with looting, etc)\n\n\n#### Features to come\n- Implement resource-pack driven system for defining custom conditions and how to parse them.\n- Add in fishing and other gameplay loot\n\n\n","published":"2022-09-25T22:13:18.112945Z","updated":"2024-07-08T16:18:17.891555Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":877500,"followers":259,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["g010jnKd","YvsiPoNW","sMYv0WU4","rEZyE6x3","hME9LTtZ","iiGhUAPe","UoqcWBE6","dsAxQzyr","R27L5Wrs","dDsA0q1m","AnKDZCEA","nkW4UzlO","OeVpkByV","byhOHBwi","pFHgMv8g","FzY7HsGk","WLrmskq7","TM0YFork","h5EhjjmQ","nH2jMxUZ","finLaORs","8VxvWtcW","b7JoJE05","p0Ugm9eu","odt1Mqrz","YZu0lWye","48q801AN","vWadFDyM","ge7Vbplt","9rpAPYB9","Xn48U1HI","Rp2bjZ9t","mPCfosCw","x6vIf3HD","tR4xqoxp","7rjmttb6","7fjkgVEh","GUbMMJRo","91c49w5V","95aOKine","O3uMSDN0","6rFgo1Px","lwhMjJHL","DnmJpY7Z","QmFv0252","F12qyiT2","htztuG2C","bStOmyQ8","l8uqaFoj","Och9ldiP","ZkDaJFMU","VhcPzhEp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/dec44ad1547e774b6fce97a5268f6ff6309ec40a.png"},"version":{"id":"lwhMjJHL","project_id":"qbbO7Jns","author_id":"ANKRvkxl","featured":false,"name":"EMI Loot 0.6.6+1.20.1","version_number":"0.6.6+1.20.1","changelog":"* Update of condition icons, thanks to [gayasslily](https://modrinth.com/user/gayasslily)!\n* Fix thundering/not-thundering condition icons being missing\n* Added `canSend` check to packets\n* Fixed chest loot parsing not reading in chances added via `RandomChanceLootCondition`\n* Added ru_ru lang, thanks to [mpustovoi]https://github.com/mpustovoi)!\n* Fixed loot recipes not updating on datapack reload, thanks to [Abbie5](https://modrinth.com/user/Abbie)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-14T19:44:38.123888Z","downloads":207205,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"1ecb08d3a45f000e835e9214eb6bae282bd8fdb0","sha512":"ee215cef8c3a916d1ee084de1804c343c0167ae20123a03f60185c79fb6480db6c7a949769637eef834c31a0497afe8cffb002ddb739db9bec42bdc7be6ca417"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/versions/lwhMjJHL/emi_loot-0.6.6%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"emi_loot-0.6.6+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":363534,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"fRiHVvU7","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"A6CuhMKl","user":{"id":"fjpxz8db","username":"gayasslily","name":"Lily","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/fjpxz8db/8008d5d853889ec78ed06111577a56de684d0044.png","bio":"Creator of the modpack 'Lily's Vanilla OverQuilted'.\n\nI also make textures for stuff.","created":"2022-06-10T14:24:39.516887Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"A6CuhMKl","user":{"id":"ANKRvkxl","username":"fzzyhmstrs","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72876796?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-13T21:42:13.876320Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"emi_loot-0.6.6+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\seasonhud-fabric-1.20.1-1.9.8.jar":{"sha512":"9724bfdaa9b0becacb00b9b982f88e378d093b0575eac9453d1d98334c1bbf12d3dace14fb1f42e0f8df51b540cee216d6b4b3b0bf188d7fd502c7fb72dd8b89","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"iDiIfZLX","slug":"seasonhud-fabric","project_type":"mod","team":"2kiGJQ8O","title":"SeasonHUD-Fabric","description":"This is an addon for FabricSeasons that displays the current season on the HUD or under the minimap","body":"**[Forge Version]**\n\nThis is an client-side addon for FabricSeasons that displays the current season on the HUD.

During each tick, the client will do some vector math to calculate lightmaps for blocks and the sky, then upload that new texture to the GPU. However, this can be completely avoided and cached if nothing affecting brightness is changed. This mod will cancel lightmap updates if nothing that changes brightness (e.g. gamma slider, potion effects) has changed. \n- **Sky color calculation optimizations**<p>\n  Minecraft uses `CubicScampler.sampleColor` every frame to calculate the current sky color. This function loops 216 times to factor in surrounding biomes-even if all surrounding biomes are identical or have identical sky colors. This mod makes this function only get called if you are between biomes with different sky colors and only makes it get called every tick. Otherwise, a shorter, simpler and faster sky color calculation is used.\n- **Don't do debug logic if we don't need to**<p>\n  Minecraft has four debug renderers that can be activated with a debug server: bees, game events, game test and villager AI. Even if there's nothing to process, the logic for these debug renderers are still executed. This mod will only execute them if debug is enabled and there is data to process.\n\n<p>\nThat's all the major ones, at least.\nYou can disable any optimization in the config file if you need to.\n</p>\n\n## But how much does it help?\n*(tested on my own PC with an RTX 3060, intel i7 12700 and 4GB of allocated ram on Fabulously Optimized)*<p>\nWithout toasts, it goes from 1926-1955 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/523f9117-5dfb-469a-a1e3-2e5c32597057\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 2008-2023 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/a27fcfab-c9ac-4fb0-9dfa-fc2efc61b2f4\" width=\"256\"><p>\nAnd with toasts, it goes from 1351-1384 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/859f710b-036e-4080-9e94-ceaaf5a9bbf9\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 1414-1458 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/5a01d4a7-0789-465d-a08f-aaa54386deb7\" width=\"256\"><p>\n\n## Dependencies?\nNone.\n\n*(Also available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/badoptimizations)!)*","published":"2023-12-03T23:38:30.615171Z","updated":"2024-06-15T06:13:29.544303Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1670685,"followers":622,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["4iRxgKYG","7EtZn21b","LvWnmLrW","CMQm449N","QPNT0tat","ww747oVi","R5epQB48","7mkIryQX","N83O7mRY","tPcndzIs","Rya4Prxg","P1VV7yAB","osrW6S8S","5iiizW8v","NPtJUzCQ","xrCxVWjv","csMggyw8","pYctvKKH","ByJJBuGh","frxUrBuZ","f80P5Er3","ajq5p3Cr","lVUqygYP","6qzarF6r","py5wZc1k","9vTW5SzW","ouYuE0eo","RppoOA91","o0gYJCDi","x9zMt7t7","Tyi2q14M","QFKaP0NG","PY8WFC19","YPx40hkR","WZB4pQ3u","l5RWBdez","yK1K2DcH","pNkHByNm","tfPcVhXP","NepFM2XR","74fRkfKB","PXrqBQZG","O6GYJnvX","vJEBno3y","84AEMPgv","DkQi3drk","KWwNfrjN","wlqlZ5hE","37M8Rd4S","KeVurIPw","8JJc3kIM","r88RTaW8","Go4FoZir","dAVlOLS6","cpFHy43X","bOuSwVyc","aKkny43Y","918aozAU","zLWPzGCh","Gsub2Uuo","ydYsXrGL","eT6Jsaq5","zZYSuJ5b","bpmrr094","lqrDW4fz","V222vBVT","HPufvV6Z","2Aygc6Sx","faqoQF36","QitPsCFU","fPU2qEYo","Yvu9MYgX","YIdCgnz1","LJwG3VNe","eCxTPnVB","iULB5JCQ","FPQdPmAW","xhGlhCut","GydKiUd0","iXgx6zFq","j3hOwXG0","XYBqWKD2"],"icon_url":null},"version":{"id":"GydKiUd0","project_id":"g96Z4WVZ","author_id":"MtdsrsRk","featured":true,"name":"2.1.4 (1.20.1)","version_number":"2.1.4","changelog":"I just can't catch a break can I.  \n- Fix an issue where light/sky colors wouldn't react to time properly  \n\nHOPEFULLY no more critical issues after this-then 1.19 versions won't receive any more updates.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-15T06:00:50.191020Z","downloads":138834,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"29c7689d1c4645a902115e1faa4991c47007b7a5","sha512":"a68968e8fab27202f0d2737357511e27282967ced27732cc90d6beaff64cb99359448b7de3e24cdef4e564ecb99ed061ac1e336e07d8ab4771db47bec7c5da45"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/g96Z4WVZ/versions/GydKiUd0/BadOptimizations-2.1.4-1.20.1.jar","filename":"BadOptimizations-2.1.4-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":421754,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"8syA22fZ","user":{"id":"MtdsrsRk","username":"thosea","name":"Thosea","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/MtdsrsRk/3f5159d38faa7b19426cc1ea6c76036a4e509c18.webp","bio":"@thosea on discord","created":"2023-08-22T16:13:26.975044Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"BadOptimizations-2.1.4-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\combatroll-fabric-1.3.2+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"b399e53b362c5cea4038d6bc4a66285271979c6278d42f150fec798f57a56c58f15b0896e877a83127356f1dfe91f578c56070f798e5dd04f9f9a8c3def86355","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"wGKYL7st","slug":"combat-roll","project_type":"mod","team":"oKdlkn0S","title":"Combat Roll","description":"🧶 Adds combat roll ability, with related attributes and enchantments.","body":"![Combat Roll](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGKYL7st/images/a76b8371abdb17c1f502b293eb1fc9f6a259fb9d.png)\n\nEver wanted to roll/dodge/dash in Minecraft?

(Server side configurable)\n\nCooldown of your combat roll ability can be seen on the main UI (aka HUD). (Client side configurable)\n\nExhaust (aka hunger) is added to the player upon rolling (Server side configurable)\n\nRoll ability can only be used when player is: not using item, not jumping, not swimming.\n\n**New!** Now with invulnerability frames!

When on the ground, they'll lay flat and compact stacks\n\n \n\n - **Enhanced Pickup and Tooltips**: You can pick up items by right-clicking them, even from a few blocks away. When looking at one, you'll see it's tooltip rendered below your crosshair.\n\n \n\n - **Item Filter**: The Item Filter is an Item that allows you to finely control which items you want to automatically pick up. You can configure it to use either a white- or blacklist and any items affected by that lsit will require you to explicitly pick them up using either a right-click or by sneaking. You can also globally disable auto-pickup in the config to force everyone to explicitly pick up all items.\n\n \n\n - **Item Throwing**: You can throw items by holding down the drop key for a period of time. The longer you hold it, the further you'll throw it. Items which have a damage modifier on them like Sword and Axes will also deal damage when they hit something after being thrown this way.\n\n \n\n - **Client-Only Mode**: You can use Interactic in a mode where it will automatically disable all server-side features and give you only the enhanced rendering and tooltips.\n\n \n\nAll of these features can be individually toggled in the config","published":"2021-08-03T19:06:42.818734Z","updated":"2024-08-03T15:33:02.176376Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":622742,"followers":347,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18-pre8","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19-pre3","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["xiTAqyPB","kicm7pvf","FlxdQ0Cf","YArmqQMg","7OfiG1Wu","fVMWmsTh","bahB0VI3","D7g1PZ50","gPRyWa8f","WhjBkxuI","KaaebHRh","3ZriHPeX","7LmnFHXo","tj8ZH9jV","kt7gW3fF","BukcqFnZ","M0c0R0nD","PYdrXIcA","QbrezCrF","PGo6qQqQ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ErpAAAaf/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"BukcqFnZ","project_id":"ErpAAAaf","author_id":"qGOpk8Hs","featured":false,"name":"[1.20+] Interactic - 0.2.0","version_number":"0.2.0+1.20","changelog":"This is a straightforward port to 1.20 - support for older versions will be dropped","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-09T17:18:52.520383Z","downloads":338483,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e76d57376b811a37d9c8b48121f059759783c8c74067c225ccd7172fe263c0a4e93281f98d2dbc356937b1e5e6546ea2fbe3ccc080ace454f77132e261bb6d7c","sha1":"d71b61842b1a6ac7b81c4d2be06ac06b3f128097"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ErpAAAaf/versions/BukcqFnZ/interactic-0.2.0%2B1.20.jar","filename":"interactic-0.2.0+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":111864,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"DgIYuFEF","project_id":"ccKDOlHs","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"EOzKiDsm","user":{"id":"qGOpk8Hs","username":"glisco","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15788224?v=4","bio":"she/her | creative director & tech lead\n@ Wisp Forest (https://github.com/wisp-forest)\n\n","created":"2021-03-13T09:39:29.068275Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"interactic-0.2.0+1.20.jar"},"mods\\agedaddition-1.0.6.jar":{"sha512":"cf99046b2ea2490da634d1d2239e037d1edd38c3becf6e32b7df27627116d3125c74df591dea88385966a94c2640c65226f9fb0d44bebe6af27546818d0fe2c5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Aged-Addition","description":"Adds additions mainly for the modpack Aged","authors":["xR4YM0ND","Globox_Z"],"version":"1.0.6","icon":"C:\\Users\\lelip\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\d7d6c521ee793d6b40639f26a726e4c28150893a.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"agedaddition-1.0.6.jar"},"mods\\library-fabric-20.1.5.jar":{"sha512":"84405f8899fd5b212fd2ebb34724b22ff4aa698c0797ceb95a38455755965851763b18c13f1ba87e92126e314b38fe907324442037c53c2ccfdbe4dc734f3b98","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"mWdDy9A0","slug":"phantom-loader","project_type":"mod","team":"gRXwS7Hj","title":"Phantom Loader","description":"Phantom Loader is a library that automates part of the process of creating Minecraft mods for multiple mod loaders by generating loader-specific code at build time.","body":"![Phantom Loader](https://github.com/PhantomLoader/PhantomLoader/raw/1.20.1/logo.png)\n\nPhantom Loader is a library that automates part of the process of creating Minecraft mods for multiple mod loaders by generating loader-specific code at build time.\n\n# About\n\nNormally, when creating a mod for both Fabric and Forge, mod developers have to create separate modules for both mod loaders and add loader-specific code that has mostly the same function.

Sods use vanilla grass tint, which means it will match the color from the biome it's in!\n\n\n✏️ Texture pack compatibility. All sods use vanilla textures, which means resource packs are compatible by default.\n\n\n☀️ Shader PBR compatibility. Are you using a resourcepack with PBR? Sods will have it too!\n\n\n⚙️ Vanilla & Modded map compatibility (Correct coloring on maps and minimaps like Xaero's or FTB)\n\n\n🧟 Control mob spawning.

Simulation?\nA \"boids simulation\" refers to a computer model that simulates the flocking or herding behavior observed in nature, like the coordinated movement of birds or fish. In the context of this mod, it means fish will exhibit more realistic and dynamic group movements, making your aquatic environments come to life.\n\nIn particular, each fish will follow these three rules:\n- Separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates\n- Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates\n- Cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates\n\n### Additional Resources\nYou can learn more about boids simulations here:\n- [Wikipedia - Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids)\n- [Craig Reynolds' Boids page](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/)\n- [Conrad Parkers' Boids page](http://www.kfish.org/boids/)\n","published":"2023-12-27T13:59:56.944556Z","updated":"2024-06-28T17:06:50.212813Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":71109,"followers":251,"categories":["mobs"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6-rc1","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["7uczXO1W","OeCnoEPH","4WKWsWgF","iU8B8Wkw","shuI7hpt","DN7XVrdN","Csm1PGkd","KOvowhue","14pDAJuk","aiZEd0aD"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/2OckSy74/ff9a9a95de3ef9117796a491fb17783eef820caf.png"},"version":{"id":"14pDAJuk","project_id":"2OckSy74","author_id":"ClEx9T2C","featured":false,"name":"Boids 1.2.2","version_number":"1.2.2","changelog":"- Compile with java 17\n- Fixes crash with java 17","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-27T12:24:01.355943Z","downloads":37853,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"2558461db1fa4bd6e27134599aa2a57018317ddb","sha512":"6dad511e8cc523d82ab64005664a65ebc1b3c4ab594c4c6da5966d59a825a7ab2157f4ca8cef2fc6bef2bbcf0130300a046b80f0f0390a2c9cdc6f6b26ed60d3"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/2OckSy74/versions/14pDAJuk/Boids-1.2.2.jar","filename":"Boids-1.2.2.jar","primary":true,"size":99421,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"U0OsY8Ye","user":{"id":"ClEx9T2C","username":"Tomate0613","name":"Tomate 06 13","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69756782?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-07-25T08:08:13.444171Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Boids-1.2.2.jar"},"mods\\Kiwi-1.20.1-Fabric-11.8.19.jar":{"sha512":"6ccb7a20695efe980691cc79dc40331cc74824ebe05a568b972da03f1323351e2758f56096323a8b78f77c5b489c814317352df64d9286dc97faca938754a97a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ufdDoWPd","slug":"kiwi","project_type":"mod","team":"iYrHyWgk","title":"Kiwi 🥝","description":"Minecraft modding library","body":"# Kiwi 🥝\n\nMinecraft modding library used by Snownee's mods.\n\nIt provides some QoL features (configurable):\n\n- Shows item NBT and tags in tooltips\n- Disables Microsoft's telemetry\n- Suppress experimental world settings warning (disabled by default)\n\nInstall [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) to change settings in-game.\n\n[![Interested in supporting me and the development of mods?

The new statistics screen features an easier to navigate and read UI layout, as well as a few filters and a search field that will help you find the statictics you need a lot easier, especially when there are dozens, if not hundreds of entries to keep track of.\n\n### Dependencies (v3.11+)\nNote that \"client\" refers to installing mods to the game launched through a Minecraft launcher, whereas \"server\" refers to installing mods to a server you join through the \"multiplayer\" menu.\n\n| Requirements | Client | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Better Statistics Screen](#) | Optional | Optional |\n| [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/P7dR8mSH) | Required as of `1.20.5` | Required as of `1.20.5` |\n| [TCDCommons API](https://modrinth.com/mod/Eldc1g37) | Required as of `1.21` | Required as of `1.21` |\n| [Roughly Enough Items (REI)](https://modrinth.com/mod/nfn13YXA) | Optional | Not needed |\n| [Mod menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/mOgUt4GM) | Optional | Not needed |\n\n### Some QnA\n- What about Minecraft Forge?\n    - I have no plans on making future ports to Forge or any other mod loaders. The code-bases are vastly different and such a port would cost a large amount of time and effort. See [GitHub Issue #100](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/issues/100) for more info. However, not all hope is lost! [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/u58R1TMW) is a mod that lets people run Fabric mods on Forge! Please check it out. Also keep in mind the mod is in beta (as of me writing this), so please don't be harsh towards the mod's developers while expecting the mod to work 100% of the time.\n- Port to older Minecraft versions?\n    - Nope. Same reason as the 'Minecraft Forge' one.\n- I can't pin stats to the hud. I right-click them, but REI shows up instead. How do I pin stats?\n    - Hold down the left shift button while right clicking a stat. That is, if you have REI installed.\n- For mobs and items, I am only able to pin one stat type. How do I pin for example \"times used/mined/crafted\" and so on?\n    - Once you pin an item or a mob stat to the HUD, you may right-click the pinned entry to configure it. There you will find the option to switch the stat type.\n\n## Features\nThis mod aims to improve on the existing features, as well as add additional features that may futher be helpful in tracking and managing one's statistics.  \n  \nNote that any optional features that this mod adds to the game, such as the \"/statistics\" command and the \"Stat announcement system\", may be disabled in the config or though the in-game mod settings menu.\n\n### The `/statistics` command\n**Alt command:** `/stats`  \nThis is an optional feature that adds a command that allows people (with sufficient permission levels, such as OP) to manage and view player statistics through commands. This feature may also be useful for writing datapacks that may wanna read as well as manage player statistics.  \n\n*Note: Can be disabled in the config.*\n\n**The command syntax is the following:**\n- `/statistics clear <targets>`\n- `/statistics edit <targets> <stat_type> <stat> (set|increase) <value>`\n- [ex. general stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:custom minecraft:jump set 123`\n- [ex. item stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:used minecraft:wooden_shovel set 123`\n- [ex. mob stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:killed minecraft:zombie set 123`\n\n### The \"Stat announcement system\"\nThis is an optional server-sided feature that broadcasts special messages when players do certain things or achieve certain stats or \"milestones\". As of `v3.9.7`, the SAS announces when players achieve certain stats for the first time, such as for example \"Mining their first diamond\", or \"Crafting their first item of a specific type\", and so on..  \n  \n*Note: Can be disabled in the config.*  \n  \n![The SAS in action](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/assets/66475965/3467ecae-5393-4fa9-9bf3-5146cc07f7b7)\n\n### The \"General\" statistics tab\nThis tab does not add nor show anything special regarding general statistics other than the redesigned UI layout. The filters menu features a way for you to hide all general statistics that are currently set to '0', as well as a search bar that will help you look for a specific statistic.  \n  \n![General statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/f612dcb73d9e4ffc4ca0494559a31221396c2435.png)\n\n### The \"Items\" statistics tab\nThe items tab displays items in a visual grid of items, similar to how an inventory screen does it. The items are categorized in item groups, just like they would be in the creative inventory menu. All items you interacted with are shown in this tab. This will hopefully help you find the items you are looking for easier. The search field in the filters menu can be used to look for specific items. To see a statistic for an item, place your cursor over the said item, or use \"Tab\" to navigate to it using your keyboard, and a tooltip text will display the statistics. The \"Show item names\" checkbox defines whether or not the tooltip will also show the item name.  \n  \n![Item statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/5ef05e79400d4e0d386f899dc1849f72731c0372.png)\n\n### The \"Mobs\" statistics tab\nSimilar to the \"Items\" tab, the \"Mobs\" tab will also show mobs in a grid. The mobs are visually rendered on the GUI screen, so it is easier for you to find the mob you are looking for, and because it looks nicer. Just like with the items tab, to see the statistics for a given mob, place your cursor over the said mob, or use \"Tab\" to navigate to it using your keyboard. A tooltip text will show you the statistics.  \n  \n*Note that due to technical limitations in my programming, some mobs may fail to render properly, and some mobs may even appear as \"plain text\" instead of their 3D model due to errors in my rendering method.*  \n  \n![Mob statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fd6c360face8ba7fcf05224a08044614c7eb9496.png)\n\n### The \"Food & drinks\" statistics tab (formerly \"A balanced diet\")\nThis tab aims to help you achieve the \"A balanced died\" advancement. It does that by displaying all food items in grouped grids, similarly to how the \"Items\" tab does it. This tab will show you all food items, even the ones you haven't interacted with, and will also highlight the foods you already ate before, helping you identify which foods you need to eat next to earn the advancement.  \n  \n*Note that this tab may not precisely tell you exactly which foods you do and do not need, as that kind of criteria is controlled \"server-side\", and may be modified by other mods and data-packs. As such, all foods are shown instead.*  \n\n![Food & drinks statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/9e3478d0573276349e9842337de3cf598dcf75db.png)\n\n### The \"Hostile creatures\" statistics tab (formerly \"Monsters Hunted\")\nThis tab aims to help you achieve the \"Monsters hunted\" advancement. It shows you a grid of mobs similarly to the \"Mobs\" tab, except the mobs shown on this tab are hostile creatures you have either killed or are yet to kill. Similarly to the \"Food & drinks\" tab, any mobs you have killed will be highlighted in this tab, helping you easily see which mobs you need to kill next in order to earn the advancement.  \n  \n*Note that just like with \"Food & drinks\", the criteria for getting the advancement is controlled server-side, and may be modified by other mods and data-packs. As such, all hostile creatures are always shown.*  \n\n![Hostile creatures statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fe98cfce86319282774228f4f4c81748eaa00139.png)\n\n### In-game config menu\nA menu that lets you configure the mod in-game. Nothing more or less.  \n\n![In-game config menu](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/7413856bcf4e799b7e265bcf732f17cbb1e2e7c2.png)\n\n### MCBS files\nThis is an additional feature that aims to let people save a \"snapshot\" of their current statistics, into a file, which can then be opened later or shared with other players.  \n  \n*Note that opening an MCBS file does not \"override\" you current stats, as it only shows you what your stats looked like at the time you saved the MCBS file.*\n\n![Saving a file](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/315ca6da7dcb943b3435c6a11917393786ae4367.png)\n![Opening a file](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/5f1855efceb8870339456bb1d3e8235d795f3cfe.png)\n\n### The statistics hud\nThis is another additional feature that allows you to \"pin\" any stat to the \"in-game-hud\", where you can then look at any statistic of your choosing as you play the game. To pin a stat, simply right-click it with your mouse (hold down shift as well if you have REI installed).  \n\n*Note that due to technical limitations, pinned statistics update occasionally by default, and will not update \"live\" unless this mod is installed on the server-side as well and the \"live stat updates\" is enabled on the client-side.*  \n\n![Pinning stats](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/3c7e15962f4c8a2268bc5da9a2e7d97ae7850fb6.png)\n![Configuring pinned stats](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/681f25b72304d0fdde71ab3104d51fab506c3c34.png)\n![What pinned stats look like during gameplay](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fd7f29e99ed6b73981b2e2cbcdb4eddb93a2bbcb.png)\n\n## Credits\nThank you to everyone who contributed to the project and helped translate the mod to other languages! And a special thank **you**, the person reading this, for choosing to use this mod! (Well, thank you even if you're just checking out the mod and not actually using it. That also means a lot!)\n\n### The showcase YouTube video I recorded\nI decided to test the mod as well as take screenshots and video footage of the mod in my survival world from the [Better Minecraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-fabric) mod pack, so as to show how this mod works and that it works with modded features as well. The screenshots and the video footage also feature the [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) being used alongside [Iris](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders), as well as the [BYG](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oh-the-biomes-youll-go) mod.\n\n### The screenshots I took\nResource packs and shader packs used at the time of screenshotting.\n- [Complementary shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/)\n- [3D Default](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/5aPp18Lx)\n- [3D crops Revamped](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/PgpTtNoI)\n- [Default Dark Mode](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/6SLU7tS5)\n\nSorry if I missed any. I had too many of them applied at once.","published":"2022-09-02T19:38:08.030776Z","updated":"2024-08-17T18:11:17.782198Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2218477,"followers":1657,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w13a","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["EnelgdHp","Fk8W9xAv","8RhZhQYw","94aapoJA","4rdXgAx2","uLo8KWrK","SoYOLyoj","WEev32xa","fvo5X8Xj","9eNc6jlA","SAGXYRQW","qgsvDAFG","gz1quzFI","1dR0gD57","307623Pb","F7rjMuqu","WajeE658","H4ve3iC9","oKip6o69","fbwYDHTx","PuyUL15E","wcdeU0Uk","c02NBGoz","YwgivtRx","aMHvwPf2","W7pDuGqC","E1EeTCzR","OFa15O41","QNNqgAdx","nJhfzkvB","GH2n9Xmp","z12xxYRe","823VmOAv","Ufs79Xwx","AKglt1TW","NwsPvqFn","JCedcydw","ytM62cvx","M5IJOqMW","s8PMW1n2","HMC7jXEQ","RM7Dy7vu","9PPcvO4i","UrwGLSJI","LBO8kIEp","DA4J8QTI","zuI0rtcT","oCC1YLFI","5rMFdCwJ","tGhUGisK","sb3SaBaE","QZwSwiZR","18RwTRug","vsM2NrtL","jRrE1yaP","fVJ0IIJU","yebgi9T4","w3dUagqG","8Yswy53a","h7aGFS6n","A6kv9M3f","ng46cYL0","SbiaYJpr","ODcKksFu","cTVirG90","APEn5ML0","eGcQh6sR","VXZAyG4G","dx8kubiy","OQQwqPed","77XYVAe5","5bD14l3I","pQEGz8q4","JwLjCwiB","9Nle6p3Y","XWYy9iPd","saxPMWUK","WNvtlvrR","UPxGVo2j","HZMdcy1s","flzNW6MC","rTAZet3B","S8zvr548","Ah2PN5Vd","TcpdjZq3","TJVb61wk","IRAj3Zja","rCdw3Yao","RanY7iKp","I0YaiUKC","5RoB9ulm","itZVnHEf","yLNRroby","LiBg6GMi","3Dz7ZYBA","WLBCUkWu","uxQfDyI7","UivJDox9","e3q6lD9z","zrhRDvws","rGCv0cOY","qZJRvw7w","1weQYuP0","LyAkMd7b","CdN82lOX","qGf3pduz","KOUA7KHm","E5zqzlew","hsjPjr1l","eZ6vxjVH","CTYD1jrY","hsA6tx3U","2d67uRLI","lwRehylW","9mc9uiOb","PoHesack","qdiBvpLD","cxqQA00g","nRGVPeao","sogTh4cI","cJbr3hAU","KWuKt0ct","1LjgPqG5","71Ie3Fad","25Kl4Bo0","RP77Jp7s","bGYkCuJ4","v5KSPfZS","j9GJlHWA","wyQ2nH56","tEseitwF","N1acUGhP","u3oGwdmM","u5ABQXZg","vnJYWJ44","4lGy0aaq","LsbNVGUA","7E0ghj2a","NNrDcObC","7KRgzNWt","vrAjuu6V","fA72myNS","RLXEmLF9","geaZKRmc","HyPBt1Fe","dqzzU5Hg","p5Xw2LiZ","hZs482mC","6g4qy5hA","L2ERNR7d","11foeqox","Njd7x8bl","5Ci8FUbU","W6ptfTp3","YlLOkKf9","gDMj0yIi","SHsaZzMU","abEltCPM","14Cmm7Ff","C1VysDYt","A0tzMwVS","DBDZAhwS","JdB9dfE9","ZpFQOEiP","2n9CpLEp","qkfpsoTv","LjUuZyjm","yrru4Bk4","4zvus7f3","AFfAEsKN","YGIJtdMB","P9nARxar","K4DsUBPC","bsaAduNH","931QH0rO","iCN5sXDw","9mloKCRh","8kMVRIPW","aphVtzmS","gzcXPgrI","Ktw36uDC","UXVsHEi6","DWPOKGOj","9kcwkEpR","iz25dG62","nCrLqsV1","QUR4n7cH"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"gzcXPgrI","project_id":"n6PXGAoM","author_id":"j0Ha6a2h","featured":false,"name":"BSS (fabric-1.20.1) - v3.12.4","version_number":"3.12.4+fabric-1.20.1","changelog":"Due to the demand for a backport, the latest version of BSS has now been backported to `1.20.X` versions.\n\nNote that because `v3.12.4` requires [TCDCommons API](https://modrinth.com/mod/Eldc1g37), that means that this backport **also requires** **TCDCommons API** to be installed.

Prior to `1.20.5`, pressing the `Escape` keyboard key on the Statistics screen would unpause the game instead of going back to the game menu screen, so BSS should do the same.\n- You can now `Shift+LMB` (aka shift-click) on the `Statistics` button to quickly open the vanilla statistics screen. This now serves as a shortcut that allows you to access the vanilla stats screen in less clicks.\n- The quick-share feature now logs its related events to `latest.log`, so its easier to debug any errors taking place. When submitting bug reports regarding quick-share errors, please include the logs from now on, so I can actually see what's going on.\n- To reduce network bandwidth usage, the quick-share feature will now compress the statistics using GZip prior to uploading them. I will likely be looking into finding ways to apply compression to downloads as well, so people viewing quick-shared stats can also benefit. For now, the compression only applies to uploads.\n\n## v3.12.6 changelogs\n- The \"Stat announcement system\" feature is now disabled by default, rather than being enabled by default. You can always enable or disable it at any time.\n    - This was done because people download this mod primarily for the BSS itself, whereas SAS is an optional server-sided feature that is not what everyone is here for.\n- The \"Quick-share\" feature has been tweaked a bit, so as to improve its server-sided security and reliability. The tweaks generally boil down to further helping the server combat people looking to exploit the system in a malicious way.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-08-08T09:56:42.864187Z","downloads":9093,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"412824d45c63dec7a629b9efc16ed9fe08c256a8754b54f8052b2a346c7f0febe359757077d5683321b8fffb059707b29a385ae171d6dfaf6e3fb2db26c9a0de","sha1":"bda0ac4e8937cfbe38f9a4a8aadb77f6a882407e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/versions/Ktw36uDC/betterstats-3.12.6%2Bfabric-1.20.1.jar","filename":"betterstats-3.12.6+fabric-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":385358,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Eldc1g37","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"nfn13YXA","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"betterstats-3.12.4+fabric-1.20.1.jar"},"resourcepacks\\FA+Emissive-v1.2.zip":{"sha512":"ced3e55e783a65ce67ff4d5f376814754109b86c2ee47cb0288a2efaafcb8029c1036457efac5a4b84acb2b59994f1b521bdf4ade05ecd4f5531eebca2137e93","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"YAVTU8mK","slug":"fresh-animations-extensions","project_type":"resourcepack","team":"2VgiF6Qd","title":"Fresh

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2024-08-11T17:21:31.831246Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":10855505,"followers":10771,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE","tDFVQpHO","bAbb09VF","g2qXxjsR","fsK2ycFx","OC4JOVBe","my7uONjU","p25IJhj0","5a3sPIH2","NTZCh7rb","5szYtenV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ZSNsJrPI","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium 0.11.2","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.11.2","changelog":"Lithium 0.11.2 for Minecraft 1.20.1 is the same as the previous release, just for 1.20.1 instead of 1.20.\n\nYou can check out all configuration options [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/blob/mc1.20.1-0.11.2/lithium-mixin-config.md).\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-12T23:58:59.682048Z","downloads":4250374,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8f4642147e60827f728badac7a819d1a9f3b25d5","sha512":"d1b5c90ba8b4879814df7fbf6e67412febbb2870e8131858c211130e9b5546e86b213b768b912fc7a2efa37831ad91caf28d6d71ba972274618ffd59937e5d0d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/versions/ZSNsJrPI/lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","filename":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","primary":true,"size":645865,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"uhPSqlnd","username":"2No2Name","name":"2No2Name","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50278648?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-31T09:13:58.517719Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":"JellySquid","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TEZXhE2U/f4705a5f2388c65029ae2e59f1434b3e6e4de23a.png","bio":"Professional idiot at day, maniac programmer by night.","created":"2021-01-03T00:49:18.373336Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar"},"mods\\sparsestructures-fabric-1.20.1-2.2.0.jar":{"sha512":"37e45ef14d2f353df8dbfc77890baa522da2c215b8556b03887632b3d57084553683003a3155b7ed6946b0eb6449f93525906e4dd296f37d5cbb3b52c00f0ccc","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"qwvI41y9","slug":"sparsestructures","project_type":"mod","team":"tY14R8E0","title":"Sparse Structures","description":"A simple and configurable mod that makes all (even datapacks and modded) structures more spread out (or more common!), essentially making them rarer/easier to find.

Useful in big modpacks with a lot of structures mod to encourage exploration and make the experience more challenging or balanced.\n\n> Notice: this does not alter the generation of ores/geodes or other features of this kind, and alters very slightly the terrain and trees (not enough to be an issue to most players).\n\n## Sponsor\n[![But before, let's here a quick word from my sponsor!](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/6626410f-5005-4f5b-af8c-b17e1410af20.webp)](https://www.bisecthosting.com/selector)\n\n## Examples\n![Comparison between two world on the same seed, the one on the left showing a witch hut and a mansion (without the mod), the one on the right showing the same terrain but without those structures](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qwvI41y9/images/be9e463926fb59e8314ba24c69d173ab4d636278.png)\n\n### In a modded environment:\n![First screenshot of the comparison, showing many (maybe too many) structures at once in the ocean because of the quantity of structure mods installed.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qwvI41y9/images/ae9d2621f1f12bf208a7af27738e6a9113e3de45.png)\n![Second screenshot of the comparison, showing lot less structures in the same world (seed), at the same coordinates.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qwvI41y9/images/78f2018c9beb7c9e5992b0c246313ff7c7228e03.png)\n<details><summary>Structure Mods in the picture :</summary>\nTidal towns, Explorify, all Yung's mods, Just Another Structure Pack, MVS, Explorations, Towns and Towers, Dungeons and Taverns...\n</details>\n\n## Features\n* **Configurable** : you can change the rarity of all individual structures, even from mods and datapacks.\n* **MC-177381 fix** : fixes the bug where `/locate` returns an incorrect distance between the player and the structure.\n* **Dump Structure Sets** : you can dump all structure sets to a file in the right format for the config using `/dumpstructuresets`.\n* **No separation limit** : In vanilla, the separation between structures is limited to 4096 chunks (65k blocks). This mod removes this limit, allowing structures to be even more spread out (if for any reason you need structures to be that rare).\n\n## Configuration\nThe config can be found in the `config` folder of your instance, and is named `sparsestructures.json5`. It contains the following options :\n* `spreadFactor` : the factor by which the separation and spacing of structures should be multiplied. The default value is `2`, which means that structures will be twice as rare. If you want structures to be more common, you can set this value to `0.5` for example.\n  * ⚠️ **Warning** : a very low value (like `0.01`) makes the world generation process considerably slower.\n* `customSpreadFactors` : a list of custom spread factors for specific structures. The default value makes the mansion twice as rare as an example (which has no effects with a global `spreadFactor` of 2). If you want to change the spread factor of a structure, you can add an entry to this list. Each entry is a JSON object with two fields : `name` (the name of the structure) and `spreadFactor` (the spread factor of the structure). Here's an example :\n```json5\n{\n    \"name\": \"minecraft:mansion\",\n    \"spreadFactor\": 2\n}\n// More detailed info can be found inside the config file\n```\n> Tip: you can dump all structure sets to a file in the right format by using the custom command `/dumpstructuresets`\n\nFor now (v2.0), you have to restart the game for the config to be reloaded. This behavior may change in the future.\n\n## Dependencies\nFabric API (if you're using Fabric, or use the Quilt equivalent)\n\n## Future Updates\n* Ban specific structures from generating\n* World-specific configs\n* Support for frequency-based structure generation\n* Support for structure tags in the config\n* *Open an issue on this project's repo if you have any suggestion!*\n* *~~Add a

**currently no documentation** for it, so it would probably be a very annoying experience.\n\n\n## Bug Reports and Requests\n\nYou can report bugs and request features

alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n## 📖About 📖\n</center>\n\nSmarter Farmers is a very simple mod that makes farmers a bit less dumb\n\nFarmers can now:\n- Interact, plant and replant modded crops\n- Replant crops according to some logic. No longer will they pick the first seed they have but they'll try to replant what they just harvested instead\n- If no crop is being replanted farmers will choose a new crop to plant based on the crops around it. No more lone single patches of carrots n your wheat field!\n- Accept and pick up seeds from said crops & prevent non farmers from doing the same\n- Will equip a hoe while performing their farm task. Its tier depends on their villager level\n- No longer trample farmland\n- Can plant and replant on non non vanilla farmland like blocks, tweaked via a \"farmer_plantable_on\" tag. By default includes blocks like Supplementaries' planter\n- Can harvest special non crop like blocks, tweaked via a \"crop_replaceable\" tag. By default includes stuff like Immersive Weathering's weeds and Overweight Farming and Hefty crops big crop blocks\n- Are immune to sweet berry bush damage\n- In addition all villagers will now accept and breed with any (modded) food item you throw at them\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.
